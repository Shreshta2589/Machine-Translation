3558066$ And now, ladies and gentlemen,I'm sure we'd all like to welcome an old member back into our midst,$ a member who has, for the last three years, been traveling in the Orient.$ I refer, of course, to Mr. Hardy Livingstone,$ who comes back to us bearing several scars which he claims were inflicted by tigers, but he doesn't say whether they were male or female tigers.$ Bet I could tell you, Hardy.$ But those of us who know our Livingstone have our suspicions.$ But I shouldn't be picking on Hardy, because he's promised to do us a great favor.$ He's promised to lend us that magnificent house of his for the Milk Fund Ball.$ I'm sure we all appreciate this, and I'm also certain that we'd like to hear a few words from Mr. Livingstone.$ I dare say that when I tell you that I'm glad to be back, it sounds, to say the least, banal.$ Banal!$ Careful, Hardy, ladies present.$ But my delight at being here is so genuine that nothing I say can be banal.$ Hardy, leave the room.$ It's a good word.$ Stick to it.$ As for any possible generosity of mine in letting you have your Milk Fund Ball at my house, don't consider it as that.$ Think of it, rather, as a slight gesture on my part to bring you together under my roof, where I may feel that I am somewhat, if not entirely, your host.$ Hello, boys.$ Hello, Jeff.$ Hello, Leslie.$ Hello, Jeff!$ You're late, you lucky dog.$ What's going on?$ They're still out there making speeches.$ Big plans to raise money for the Milk Fund.$ I don't know what they're going to do with all the milk when they get it.$ I suppose somebody likes it.$ I don't know.$ Big welcome home to Hardy Livingstone.$ Big offer of house for something else.$ I don't know.$ I make the one and only excuse and sneak out.$ Then I fool them and don't come back.$ Is my wife in there?Sure.$ She fools them, too.$ She matches coins all during the speeches and doesn't have to listen.$ Does she really?$ Oh, that's terrible.$ Don't be sanctimonious.$ Pretty easy for you to stay at the office tonight yourself, wasn't it?$ I stay every night.$ By golly, I believe you do, at that.$ Just came across me.$ I haven't see you play golf all summer.$ I can't get away.$ I've got a couple of deals on the fire and I can't leave them, that's all.$ That's a crazy way to live.$ You shouldn't work so hard.$ What's it going to get you?$ A million, I hope.$ Someday.$ Well, I wouldn't do it for any man.$ Neither would I, but for a certain woman.$ Well, she's pretty nice.$ I don't care much for them as a race, but she's pretty nice.$ She's wonderful, Leslie.$ I didn't begin to live until I met that girl, and there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for her.$ You're going to have me crying in a minute.$ Come on, let's have a drink.$ Where's Jeffrey?$ Oh, he had to work, poor darling.$ Isn't it awful?$ I'm glad I'm not a man.$ You're not serious?$ Of course I am.$ I couldn't bear to have so much on my mind.$ I'm the helpless type, darling.Didn't you know?$ I think I'll gamble.I feel lucky.$ Out of my way.$ We're not gambling, dear.$ She certainly cleaned me out tonight.$ Are you coming, darling?$ It's bad luck to talk, but I'm promoting something that may turn into gold any day.$ You know, I take a positively clinical interest in this man.$ What's the trouble?$ He's in love with his wife.$ I know.$ And after four years, too.$ Can't help it, boys, I'm sorry.$ Why don't you do something about it?$ It's disgraceful.$ It's worse than that, it's indecent.$ Here's to her.$ No, the Oriental woman isn't really a slave.$ She's simply been well trained, that's all.$ She knows her business.$ What about the tiger?$ It really was a tiger, but as a matter of fact, it brought me luck.$ Luck!$ Finished.$ I'll have to give you an IOU until tomorrow evening.$ Certainly, madam.$ I'll cut the cards with you.$ If I draw high, the debt's canceled.$ If not, I owe you $ 10,000, instead of five.$ Very well, madam.$ Aces high.$ Thank you, madam.$ Good night.$ Good night.$ I followed you out here.Do you mind?$ I should.$ Indirectly, you made me lose $ 10,000.$ Did I?$ You were talking behind me in that very carrying voice of yours.$ I'm sorry.$ I heard you say the word" luck."$ I thought it was a hunch.$ I should feel badly, but I'm flattered.$ Well, you needn't be.$ It wasn't your personality, Mr. Livingstone, just your very loud voice.$ Could I redeem myself by buying you a drink?$ Do you like Japanese wine?$ Oh, well, I never knew they had Japanese wine in the club.$ Not at the club, at my house.$ It will only take us a moment.$ My boat's alongside.$ Will you?$ As a climax to the evening's indiscretions?$ You're not afraid to take chances?$ Oh, no, I like to take chances.$ All right, come along.$ If I go, will you tell me all about the world, Mr. Traveler?$ That's simple.$ It's round, they say, but I've always found it quite flat, until now.$ How frightfully exciting.$ Which means...$ I'd like to see your house.$ This is my holy of holies.$ Do you like it?$ Well, I don't know.$ It's strange.$ Not to me.$ I suppose you smoke opium here, and hold all sorts of exotic rituals?$ Opium has never agreed with me, but in the Orient, some of us use it as you would cigarettes.$ Oh, how dreadful!$ That depends upon your point of view.$ It's Yama, the god of destruction.$ What's in there?$ My past.$ Your...$ Would you dare open it?$ Would you dare look at it?$ Well, is it so frightful?$ I call it my gallery of ghosts.$ How charming.$ Why, they're lovely dolls!$ Once they were lovely women who were kind to me.$ Oh, Bluebeard's chamber.$ Well, I should say that your past had been rather international.$ Perhaps in knowing many women, one is able to appreciate the one woman when she comes along.$ How negligent.$ One shelf unused.$ I still have a few years to live.$ I suppose this is her name, or have you forgotten their names?$ That's my crest.$ It's a Japanese character.$ I brand all my belongings with it.$ It means" I possess."$ What a strange man you are.$ How few people seeing you at the club realize you are like this.$ You're really two men.$ Which do you prefer?$ Well, I couldn't say.$ I don't know either.$ What's behind that door?$ Somebody's head strung up in a closet, I'm sure.$ Worse than that.Oh.$ Well, I must admit, you're very clever at planning your conquests.$ To success.$ Yours.$ Ours.$ It belonged to a Siamese princess.$ Oh, but it's marvelous!$ It's yours.$ I couldn't.$ I made you lose tonight.$ Won't you take it as some slight return?$ They're real, aren't they?$ Why, it must be worth a fortune.$ It would be worth twice as much on you.$ You'd look wonderful in it.$ You must wear it for me.$ Let me see you in it.$ I must go.$ You won't accept this?$ No, of course not.$ But why must you hurry?$ My husband will be looking for me.$ Are you in love with your husband?$ Yes.Isn't it too bad?$ Not necessarily.$ But I really am, you see.$ When shall I see you again?$ I'm awfully busy.$ You will be at the Bazaar on Wednesday.$ I'll see you there.$ Jeffrey.$ Hello, dear.$ This is Mr. Livingstone.$ He was nice enough to take me up the shore and show me his new house.$ It's really too beautiful.$ That was nice.$ It was a pleasure.If you'll excuse me?$ Good night.$ Thank you so much.$ I shall hope to see you soon.$ Well?$ You don't like him.$ Livingstone?Mmm.$ He hasn't a very good reputation with women.$ Oh, Jeffrey, do you think I was born yesterday?$ Sometimes.$ Oh, now, don't be cross with me, please.$ Darling, you mustn't mind if I'm a little jealous.$ You know why it is.$ It's because I love you more and more every day.$ Oh, sweet!$ Go on making love to me.$ I'd like to, but somebody might see us.$ Oh, shocking!$ Young matron necking with husband.$ I'm not your husband.$ Gracious.$ I'm your lover.$ Always?$ Always.$ Even if...If at times, I do things that don't please you?$ Mad things?$ Because you know, Jeffrey, I am mad.$ Mad about living.$ Things going round, I love them.$ Ferris wheels, train wheels, roulette wheels.$ You think I'm crazy, don't you, darling?$ But you'd never let me go, would you, Jeffrey?$ I'll never lose you, will I?$ Well, I don't know.$ What do you mean?$ You will if you don't haul in a little on your expenses.$ Oh...$ Money.$ Well, we have to have it to live, and we have to talk about it now and then.$ Are we broke again?$ Not exactly, but we'll have to watch ourselves until this deal comes through, because it will pretty soon, and when it does, we'll have all the money we want.$ You're not angry because I...$ Of course I'm not.$ You know, darling, I'd give you anything in the world.$ Would you?$ Would you give me $ 10,000 now?$ $ 10,000!$ What for?$ Oh, Jeffrey.$ I was only joking.$ Come on, darling, I want to go.I want to go home, and I'm going to drive.$ I want to drive fast!$ $ 14,612.$ My, what a lot of money.$ Oh, hello!$ How do you do?$ Must have been a great success.$ Yes, it was.$ Well, it deserved to be.$ The girls have all worked so hard.$ Oh, we loved it.$ I'm impressed.$ Well, we want you to be.$ Otherwise, you might take your house away from us.$ No.$ I wouldn't do that.$ Well, we wouldn't let you.$ It's too late now, anyway.$ We've made all our plans.$ It's to be Oriental, you know.$ Last year we used the American Indian motif, and by the most peculiar coincidence, practically all the members came as Pocahontas,Which the Board objected to, because they said there was some doubt as to whether she really married John Smith.$ Shall we go?$ Yes, as soon as I get the money.$ That's the important thing.$ I wouldn't even bother to put it in the bank, because we want to give it to Mr. Durkin on Wednesday.$ I'll guard it with my life.$ As long as I can keep it away from this man, everything will be easy.$ Goodbye, darling.$ Goodbye.$ Thanks so much.$ Goodbye.$ Did you notice how he never took his eyes off her one minute?$ Now, now, girls, no gossip!$ How do you mean, he never took his eyes off her?$ I'm going to drive by my house.$ No.$ I must go straight home.$ No.$ My place first.$ You see, I've decided that you should wear the Siamese princess' robe to the ball.$ No, I couldn't.Really, I couldn't.$ Your husband?$ He might object.$ Besides, I know how valuable it is.$ I'd be frightened something might happen to it.$ I'm determined you shall wear it.$ Perhaps I'm just as willful as you.$ Perhaps, but you'll compromise.$ Vanity.Oh.$ Take the package inside.$ You're very persuasive.$ You not only make me take it, but you make me feel positively virtuous in doing so.$ Don't worry.$ My motives are entirely selfish.$ I want to see you in it.$ Well, goodbye.$ Thank you.$ Oh, take that upstairs and give it to Rita, will you, Jones?$ Yes, madam.$ There's a gentleman to see you in the drawing room.$ Who is it?$ Good afternoon.$ I told you.$ Yes, Mrs. Carlyle, I know, but...$ You didn't have to come here to my home!$ Well, something happened today, something that makes it necessary for me to collect at once.$ I'm sorry.$ I can't do it today.$ But Mr. Carlyle...Oh, no, no.$ Give me two more days.$ Surely you can do that.$ Very well, but I must have it then, or I shall be obliged to present the IOU to your husband.$ Good day, madam.$ Anything else, Mrs. Carlyle?No.$ No.$ Hello, dear.$ Hello.$ Hard day?$ Sort of.$ You'd think, from the way they talk downtown, that the whole country was going to be put up for sale, cheap, in six months.$ Is it?$ No.$ When everyone is blue, it's the time to buy.$ When the crowd's buying, it's the time to sell.$ I know that, and everybody knows it.$ But it's terribly hard to get people to put money into a deal, feeling as they do.$ I'm sorry you have to work so hard, Jeffrey.$ Oh, I didn't mean to talk about it.$ It's my job.$ I have a number of things on my mind, that's all.$ Jones said you came in with someone?$ Yes, Hardy Livingstone.$ You know what I think of him.$ Yes, I know, darling, but he happened to drop by the Bazaar, and asked if he could drive me home.$ There's nothing wrong in that.$ These bills came in today.$ Darling, you must try to economize.$ Just a little longer.$ Any day now, this deal may come through, and then you can buy the whole city, if you like.$ I don't mean to be extravagant, Jeffrey.$ I know.$ You just don't think, that's all.$ Darling, nearly $ 1,000 there, just for clothes.$ Heaven knows, I want to see you look lovely, but...$ Oh, now don't be mad with me.$ I love you so.$ Yes, I know, but you can't ignore details.$ That's true.$ Yet they tell us love is everything.$ It isn't, is it?$ You sound so hopeless.$ Well, sometimes it seems that way.$ Darling, what's wrong?$ Money!$ Money?$ Oh, I didn't mean that.$ Don't worry, we'll have it soon.$ Well, let's not talk about it, darling.$ Isn't there something gay we could do tonight?$ Yes, let's go out for dinner.$ Will you have dinner with me, Mrs. Carlyle?$ Where shall we go?$ I know, Jeffrey.$ Let's go to that funny little speakeasy where you asked me to marry you.$ What a place!$ I'll see you in my dreams$ Hold you in my dreams$ Naughty, naughty.$ I caught you.Oh.$ Hello, Terrell.$ Sit down.$ That's what I'm trying to do.$ Hey, waiter.$ Always making love to his wife.$ Of course, I don't blame him.Oh.$ What's doing down at your end of the street?$ You should know.$ Well, I'll tell you why I came over here.$ Not to interrupt this love scene, but to let you in on something I just got a hold of that's hot.$ Yes?$ United Copper.$ You're crazy.$ I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't know.$ You think you know, but...$ In 24 hours, it's going to double in value.$ Now I know you're all tied up in another proposition, but take my tip, raise a little money on the side and get into this thing.$ Mmm-mmm.But, Jeffrey, if it's going to double...$ Now, darling, you don't understand these things.$ I've got a hunch.$ You're always having hunches, dear.$ That's the trouble with your husband, Elsa.$ He's too conservative.$ Jim Blake is a pal of mine, and his father-in-law runs the pool, and he tells me that inside of a week it will be up 100%.$ Now take it or leave it.$ If I do this, I don't want Jeffrey to know anything about it.$ Well, you see, it's money I won at bridge.$ In that case, I suppose...$ Well, there's no reason why you should have to tell him, is there?$ No, there really isn't.$ After all, it's your business.$ And you're absolutely certain that I can double my money?$ That's my opinion.$ I've put everything I own into it.$ All right, then.$ I want to invest $ 10,000.$ I just deposited the money in the bank this morning.$ I'll send you a check as soon as I get home.$ Aren't you ready?$ Almost.$ If you ask me, I think I look silly in this darn thing.$ Darling, I think you look divine.$ Why don't you tell me what you're going to wear?$ Because I want to surprise you.$ Now don't look.$ Close your eyes.$ All right.$ Now!$ Why, Elsa.$ Why, those are real.$ That must have cost a...$ Where'd you get it?$ It was loaned to me.$ Livingstone?Mmm-hmm.$ You don't mind, Jeffrey?$ You know I do.$ Oh, darling.Don't you want me to wear it?$ Livingstone won't miss a chance like this.$ He'll tell everyone.$ Well, what of it?$ What'll they think?$ Ridiculous, Jeffrey.$ Quite!$ But the gossips won't think so.$ Don't you see how it makes me look?Like a fool!$ All right.$ I'm sorry, Jeffrey.$ I only wanted you to be proud of me.$ Oh, go on.$ Wear it.$ I'm sorry I mentioned it.$ Oh, darling.$ You're so sweet.$ And you will be proud of me when you see me in it.$ You wait.$ It's so beautiful.$ Mr. Livingstone.$ Yes?$ Mrs. Carlyle?$ Who wants her?$ Telephone, sir.$ There she is.$ Mrs. Carlyle, you are wanted on the telephone.$ Phone?$ Yes, madam.$ Thank you.$ Yes.$ Hello.$ Mrs. Carlyle?$ I tried to get you at the house, they said you went to the Ball.$ Mrs. Carlyle, listen, I...$ What?$ What's that you're saying?$ But you're joking.$ But you said there wasn't a chance to lose.$ You...$ You don't know what this means to me.$ Hello?Hello?Hello?$ You cut me off, Central...$ Is it so terrible?$ I don't know what to do.What'll happen to me?$ I've got to have it.$ What?$ Money?$ I've got to have $ 10,000.$ Can't your husband give it to you?$ He hasn't got it, and he mustn't know, ever!$ Oh, this is awful.$ It wasn't mine.$ It was the club's.$ I can't stand the disgrace.I can't.$ I've got to get it somehow.$ I can let you have it.$ You?$ No.No.$ Why not?$ I have the money, and naturally, it upsets me to see you like this.$ Why, it's so simple.$ I can let you have the money tonight.$ Now, there's nothing to worry about.$ Nobody will know.$ It will be our secret.$ I don't ask much in return, only that you be a little nicer to me.$ And maybe...$ Maybe some evening soon, you'll come to see me.$ I'll be in the shoji room in half an hour.$ Elsa, darling, I'm simply exhausted, so I'm leaving now.$ But hasn't it really been a marvelous success?$ My dear, we made $ 3,000 over our estimate.$ I couldn't be more excited.$ Oh, Elsa, you needn't bother about the money.$ Oh.Needn't I?$ No, because Mr. Durkin is going to take care of everything.$ Now, let me see.How will we get it to him?$ Oh, I'll tell you.I'll see you tomorrow at bridge, and then you can turn the funds over to me and I'll see that he gets it.$ Oh, that will be fine, Louisa.$ Well, I'll see you at 4: 00, then.$ Yes.All right.$ Good night, darling.$ Good night.$ You've been with Livingstone all this time?$ I was in there, Jeffrey.$ I don't feel very well.$ This is so heavy.$ Shall we go?$ Yes.$ I'll get my things.$ Tomorrow evening.$ I think you'll find this all right, Louisa.$ Yes, that agrees with my figures.$ I went over it again last night.$ Oh, thank you, darling, that's fine.$ I'll turn it right over to Mr. Durkin, and the whole thing will be off our hands.$ But I do think we've done splendidly, don't you?$ I certainly do.$ Best year we've ever had.Ooh!$ Room full of beautiful women.$ Hello, Jeffrey.$ How do you do, Mrs. Albright?$ Hello, Jeffrey.$ Hello, Audrey.$ Oh, here's my favorite man.$ Mrs. Byron, how are you?$ Tea, darling?$ No thanks, dear.$ Well, now that we've finished our business and caught a glimpse of the charming Mr. Carlyle, we really must go.$ Don't hurry.$ No, please, don't.$ Oh, we must.$ It's been lovely, Elsa.$ And I'll see you Friday at Audrey's.$ Right.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye, Jeffrey.$ Goodbye, Elsa.$ Bye-bye.I'll be seeing you on Friday.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye, all, then.$ Elsa.$ Elsa.$ Jeffrey, what's the matter?$ Jeffrey, darling, what're you doing?$ What is it?$ Darling, we're rich.$ Rich?$ I put it over.$ The papers are signed.We're rich!$ This morning I had practically nothing.$ And now we're worth a million.$ You understand, darling?$ A million!$ We're rich!$ Oh, Jeffrey, are we really?$ It's true.Isn't it wonderful?$ Oh, it's marvelous.$ Now we'll take a trip this summer.$ Anywhere you want to go.$ Just to travel?$ And not think about money.$ We'll go to Europe, to France, the Italian Riviera.$ Darling, just think of it!$ New sights.$ New people.$ It'll be wonderful.$ Let's celebrate tonight, shall we?$ Yes.Where shall we go?$ No, wait.$ What?$ You're going to wear these.$ Oh, Jeffrey!$ Darling.$ But they're the most lovely ones I've ever seen.$ Put them on me.$ My pearls.$ I'll go.$ Hello?$ Yes.$ This is Mrs. Carlyle speaking.$ I'm expecting you tonight.$ Tonight?$ Oh, but I can't.$ It's quite impossible.$ Do you want me to come to your house after you and ask your husband's permission?$ No.No.$ All right, I'll be there.I'll be there.$ Yes.Yes, that's all right.$ Goodbye.$ Who was that?$ Oh, that was Mrs. Albright's secretary.$ What did she want?$ There's to be a meeting this evening.$ You have to go to it?$ I'm afraid so.$ Funny, Mrs. Albright didn't say anything about it when she was here.$ Yes.$ Well, it came up quite unexpectedly.$ I'm awfully sorry.$ But it's frightfully important.$ Jeffrey, if I wanted some money, a lot of it, right now,$ could I have it?$ Of course.$ Well, I need $ 10,000.$ What for?$ A gambling debt.$ At the club?$ How did you know?$ A man came to me with your IOU today.$ I paid him.$ That was sweet of you, darling.$ That isn't all.$ I owe $ 10,000 more.$ $ 10,000 more?$ I've got to have it right away.$ All right.$ I'll give you a check.$ Oh, Jeffrey...$ Please don't be angry with me.$ I know I was foolish.$ I made a mistake.$ I'm awfully sorry.$ It won't happen again I promise you.$ Jeffrey?$ Put it there.$ Yes, sir.$ I'm through with you for the evening.$ Yes, sir.$ I don't want to be disturbed.Understand?$ Yes, sir.$ I didn't expect you to come that way.$ I didn't want to be seen.$ Oh, you'll be here often.$ No, no, no.$ I can't stay.$ Here's your money.$ My money?$ It's yours.$ I owe it to you.$ You misunderstood me.$ I didn't lend you that money.$ I gave it to you.$ Yes, as part of a bargain.$ This check cancels it.$ Come now, Elsa.$ We didn't make that kind of a bargain.$ Oh, please, don't.$ Can't you see that I don't want to stay?$ You've changed since yesterday.$ Oh, you don't understand.$ I do understand you, Elsa.Perfectly.$ Better than you understand yourself.$ You have money now, and I'm of no further use to you.$ But if you're trying to appeal to my better nature, it's hopeless!$ For I haven't any.$ You're going to stay here.$ You made a promise, and you're going to keep it.$ I'd rather kill myself.$ Kill yourself?$ All right.$ Do it.$ Go ahead.$ We're alone.$ I've dismissed the servants.$ We're back a mile from the road.$ Nobody will hear you.$ Well?$ Really, this is too absurd.$ Why, we're both behaving outrageously.$ You're not the kind of man...$ You don't know what kind of man I am.$ But I'll show you.$ See this?$ You recognize this?$ You know what this means?$ It means that because you made a promise,I was fool enough to think you were mine.$ I even marked it as mine.$ You want to go?$ All right.$ You can.$ I'll let you go, but you'll carry my mark on you.$ No, no, not yet.Not yet.$ No!No!$ No!$ You cheat!$ Now, show

paper.$ Paper?$ Rita, take this away.Take it away!$ Rita, get me something to wear.$ Anything.Hurry up!$ Oh, no.$ Hello, Jeffrey.$ Hello, Elsa.$ My dear, why did you let them do this?$ There's so much for you to tell me, Elsa, so much.$ Easy.$ There, that's all right.$ I don't think it'll be necessary for you to have a nurse.$ I'll drop in again this afternoon.$ Thank you, Doctor.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye.$ Then I heard a shot, almost as if someone else had fired, and he staggered and fell against the wall.$ I ran away.$ I came home and waited.$ Waited all night.$ In the morning, I saw the papers.$ I knew what had happened.$ And now I'm going to the police and confess.$ No, no, you mustn't confess.$ How else am I going to get you out of this?$ You're not going to get...$ But I am.You didn't do anything.$ You don't think I'd let you...$ Elsa, be quiet.$ I won't.$ I can't.$ Oh, Jeffrey,I've been thinking all night about myself, how wicked and selfish and spoiled I am.$ And how good you are, and how little I deserve you.$ I've got to tell the truth.$ That's the least I can do.$ Darling...$ You mustn't call me darling.$ Yes, I must.$ You are my darling.$ I've brought you nothing but trouble.$ No, dear.$ Some trouble, but much happiness.$ I'm a silly woman.Stupid and vain.$ I love you.$ I didn't marry you because I thought you could spell or add, but because you're what you are.$ I still love you, and want to protect you.$ Jeffrey!$ Please don't.$ Why don't you hate me?$ I could stand that better.$ Don't cry.$ Well, what do you want me to do?$ Don't say anything to anybody.$ Don't even talk about the case.$ Just leave it to me and to the lawyer.$ But Jeffrey...$ It'll be all right.$ Livingstone isn't dead, and he isn't going to die.$ He wants revenge.He wants to drag us into court and make a scandal, but he can't do anything.$ We have money now, and we can fight him.$ I'll get off.$ Suppose you don't.$ But I will.$ Suppose he should tell at the trial?$ That wouldn't put him in a very good light.$ He won't tell.$ Promise me before I go.$ Promise me you won't talk.$ But Jeffrey...$ Promise me.$ You're sure it's all right?$ Absolutely.$ Because I believe in you like God.$ You wouldn't deceive me, now, would you?$ No.Time's up.$ And Jeffrey, listen, from now on I'm going to be different.$ I am, truly.$ I'm going to be good,I'm going to try and be worthy of you with all my heart.$ I'll never deceive you again as long as I live.$ I may do silly things, I suppose I will, but I'll always tell you.$ Oh, I love you so.$ Time's up.$ Is Jeffrey safe?$ Is he all right?$ I hope so.$ I want you to tell me the truth.$ I must know.It's impossible to know.$ I can only tell you what I think.$ Well?$ I think we'll get your husband off without any trouble, but Livingstone's a tricky person.$ It's not easy to anticipate just what move he'll make.$ I'm sure he'll try to get back at you if he can.$ Then there might be even prison.$ Yes, there might, but I don't think so.$ I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, Mrs. Carlyle.$ Thanks.$ You are in the employ of Mr. Livingstone?$ Yes, sir.$ I came to this country with Mr. Livingstone two years ago.$ On the night Mr. Livingstone was shot, where were you?$ I was in my room with the other two servants.$ What did you do when you heard the shot?$ Well, first I didn't know what to do, because Mr. Livingstone said he did not wish to be disturbed.$ So, you see, I was afraid to go down.$ Then we made up our minds to find out what had happened, and ran downstairs.$ What did you find there?$ I saw Mr. Livingstone lying wounded on the floor, and Mr. Carlyle was standing there with a gun in his hand.$ You mean the defendant there?$ Yes, sir.$ What did you say to Mr. Carlyle?$ I said to Mr. Carlyle," Who did it?"$ And how did he answer you?$ He said," I shot him."$ Mr. Livingstone, tell the court in your own way what happened on the night you were shot.$ Well, I'm afraid I'll have to go back a few days before that, to the occasion of a gambling debt.$ A little game with Mr. Carlyle.$ Jeffrey?Shh.$ Mr. Carlyle had lost to me considerably at cards, to be exact, $ 10,000.$ He explained he was in financial difficulties and asked if I'd take his IOU, which I did.$ A few days later, I needed money, and I telephoned Mr. Carlyle and reminded him of his IOU.$ He promised to bring the money that evening.$ When he came, I noticed that he'd been drinking.$ He seemed in a rather reckless mood.$ He handed me the check for the amount.$ Exhibit 32-A, please.$ Is that the check, Mr. Livingstone?$ Yes.$ Then he suggested that we play a game for the check.$ If he lost, he owed me double.$ If he won, he kept the check.$ I agreed.$ As I went to a table drawer to get some cards,Oh... it happens that I keep a pistol in the same drawer...$ Jeffrey, I can't stand this.$ Remember your promise.$ Mr. Carlyle caught sight of the gun.$ We started playing.$ Well...$ Go on, Mr. Livingstone.$ Well, to put it bluntly, he cheated.$ No.$ Cheated!$ Order!$ I won't let him say that about you!$ Elsa!$ Quiet, quiet!$ Please, Mrs. Carlyle, please...$ Continue, Mr. Livingstone.$ Naturally, I was angry.I...$ I threatened to expose him, have him put out of the club.$ Before I knew it, he rushed to the table drawer and opened it.$ I made a lunge for the pistol, but he got there first and he fired.$ Your witness.$ May it please the Court,I should like to reserve the right to cross-examine this witness later on, if the prosecutor has no objection.$ No objection.$ Granted.$ The State rests, Your Honor.$ Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury,I'm going to reverse the general order of things a bit, and first ask the defendant to tell you his story in a simple and straightforward manner.$ Mr. Carlyle.$ Mr. Carlyle.$ Jeffrey, you've got to let me tell them the truth.$ It'll be all right.$ Jeffrey!$ Raise your right hand.$ Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?$ I do.$ Now, Mr. Carlyle, will you please tell the jury your story?$ I have nothing to say.$ But, Mr. Carlyle, you...$ I corroborate absolutelyMr. Livingstone's testimony.$ No!$ No!He's innocent.$ Elsa!$ He didn't do it, I did it.$ Don't listen to her.$ You must listen to me.$ I object.$ You've got to hear me, all of you.$ I shot him!$ I shot him!$ My husband took the blame to save me.$ He wouldn't let me tell the truth because of the scandal.$ But I can't go through with this.$ He's innocent.$ I did it.$ I gambled money that wasn't mine and lost.$ I didn't know what to do, I was desperate.$ I was so ashamed.$ I couldn't tell my husband.$ Then he...$ He offered me the money.$ I knew what he wanted.$ I'm not trying to make excuses for myself.$ There aren't any.$ But I was crazy.$ I was so frightened that I'd be found out.$ Then my husband gave me a check and I went to Livingstone to pay him back, but he wouldn't take the money.$ He wanted me, he was insane.$ He tried to force me to stay with him.$ And when I wouldn't...$ And when I wouldn't, he did this to me.$ He did this to me!$ He branded me!$ He branded me and I shot him!$ I shot him and I'm glad.$ I'm glad!$ Get Livingstone!$ I'm glad...$ Order!$ Gentlemen, take your places.$ Your Honor,I move the indictment be dismissed.$ The indictment is dismissed.$ Stand up, Mr. Carlyle.$ You are a free man.$ Darling, it's over.$ Yes.$ You must think of it as a bad dream.$ Now you're awake.$ Yes, that's it.$ Well, now that we're beginning again, Mrs. Carlyle, don't you think I ought to propose to you?$ Oh, Jeffrey!$ Well, how about it?$ Darling, this is a dream, a beautiful one.$ No, this time it's real.$ More real than before?$ You bet.$ No betting.$ Sure?$ Sure.$ Nothing but double solitaire.$ Us.$ Always.$

103982$ This is David Skal, and I bid you welcome to Universal's Dracula.$ I'm going to spend the next hour and 15 minutes as your tour guide to one of the most influential yet underappreciated films in Hollywood history.$ Introduced by novelist Bram Stoker in 1897,$ Dracula is one of the most durable fictional creations in modern times.$ The Universal film, directed by Tod Browning, secured the master vampire's image for the age of mass media.$ But Stoker himself would barely have recognised most of the Draculas we've known and loved in the 20th century, and therein lies a tale.$ I'll discuss the simultaneously produced Spanish-language versión, also included on this special edition, and will draw extensively from Stoker's original novel, from the stage adaptations, from Universal's final shooting script, and earlier scripts and treatments,$ all to better illuminate the creative processes and creative conflicts that forged the most indelible image of a vampire the world has ever known.$ The coach rumbling our way is real, even if the mountains aren't.$ The entire image was captured live in the camera in a single take, through an interesting process.I'll explain a bit further on.$ Here we meet Carla Laemmle, the niece of Universal's founder Carl Laemmle, delivering the first lines of dialogue ever spoken in a supernatural horror talkie.$ I should mention that Carla is also the host and narrator of our special documentary supplement, The Road to Dracula, which you can access through the main menu.$ ... nosferatu.$ The word" nosferatu" has a special significance in the history of Dracula, which we will explore in due time.$ The peasants are reciting the Lord's Prayer in Hungarian.$ The signage you will glimpse on the inn's exterior wall is also in Hungarian.$ When Bram Stoker wrote Dracula, the region around the Borgo Pass was part of Transylvanian Hungary.$ Today it's in Romania, where Dracula tourism is a big part of the economy.$ Just like Renfield, actor Dwight Frye is very much a stranger in a strange land, having only recently arrived in Hollywood after a varied career as a Broadway actor.$ And, like Renfield, little does he know what he's in for.$ More about that later.$ In the film versión, Renfield has replaced the novel's hero Jonathan Harker as the real-estate agent who has come to Transylvania to sell Dracula a home.$ The innkeeper is Michael Visaroff, a Russian-born character actor who fled his homeland after the Bolshevik revolt.$ He acted on the New York stage for some years, coming to Hollywood in 1924, at first working for Paramount.$ Tod Browning used him in a parallel role in 1935's Mark of the Vampire for MGM.$ He appeared in the opening sequence of Tod Browning's Freaks in 1932, and in dozens of colourful cameos in major productions such as Morocco, Anna Karenina, and Camille.$ He was a mainstay of the Russian colony in Hollywood for nearly three decades.$ In a macabre endnote to his life and career,$ Visaroff figuratively left his own coffin in 1951, when a New York paper erroneously reported his death.$ Finding his employment prospects suddenly curtailed,$ Visaroff appealed to the columnist Louella Parsons, who publicly confirmed that reports of the actor's death, like Mark Twain's, were greatly exaggerated.$ But just a few weeks later, as Parsons was still contradicting reports of the actor's demise, she received the news that Michael Visaroff actually had died, carried away by a sudden bout of pneumonia.$ Today, Transylvanian innkeepers will do almost anything to encourage travellers to visit the real Dracula's castle.$ Or at least its designated surrogate.$ The movies tell us that the crucifix is an effective vampire repellent, a representation to believers of the true death and Resurrection of Christ, as opposed to the blasphemous inversión of the Resurrection shown by a vampire.$ In more recent films and novels, vampires are less likely to cower before the cross.$ In Universal's 1979 remake, for instance, the dynamic is completely reversed.$ Not only is Dracula unaffected by the symbol, but the cross itself bursts into flames in Dracula's presence.$ Cinematographer Karl Freund was a pioneer of the moving camera.$ In Germany he had filmed Metropolis for Fritz Lang, and The Last Laugh for FW Murnau.$ In Dracula he seems constrained, perhaps by director Browning, who was traditionally partial to a more static camera, and tracking shots like this appear only sporadically.$ Coming up is the first supernatural vampire ever depicted in Hollywood, actress Geraldine Dvorak, formerly Greta Garbo's stand-in at MGM.$ And here, in an unforgettable shot, the 1931 public first met Count Dracula, in the person of Bela Lugosi.$ He seems to pull us toward him, each audience member a potential victim.$ Notice that that shot was off-centre.$ This results from the original full-aperture image being masked on one side, to make room for the optical soundtrack.$ This next scene is highly atmospheric, but it does present a puzzle.$ In the novel, the Spanish film versión, and the antecedent film Nosferatu,$ Dracula's face is completely muffled.$ It's incomprehensible that Renfield later fails to recognise the driver at the castle.$ The shooting script calls for Dracula to be, quote:$ " almost completely hidden in the folds of his great cloak, and has a hat pulled down over his face, so that nothing of him is visible, save a pair of bright, almost feverish, eyes." Unquote.$ The Borgo Pass is a real location, but not a place Stoker or his adaptors had actually visited.$ In reality it's a lushly forested region, but both the novelist and the filmmakers wanted something more atmospheric.$ From the shooting script, quote:$ " There are queer, grotesque-looking trees, with twisted black branches, huge misshapen rocks that in moonlight seem to take on fantastic shapes."$ " The whole area through which the coach is passing has a grim, macabre quality, as if taken bodily from a Doré steel engraving."$ As discussed in our documentary supplement, upcoming is a" glass shot".$ The upper portion of the image is painted on glass mounted in front of the camera, and photographed simultaneously with the live action.$ The coach and rocky roadbed are live, and the rest of the image is an optical illusión.$ The geological formations in the lower part of the picture can still be visited at Vasquez Rocks Park, in the Antelope Valley north of Los Ángeles.$ The horses being led by a bat was the invention of screenwriter Fritz Stephani, who imagined the scene in Universal's first treatment for Dracula in June, 1930.$ Renfield's cautious approach to the door of Castle Dracula is emblematic of Hollywood's attitude toward Dracula himself.$ Although the stage play had earned more than $ 2 million in America alone, the studios were as much repelled as attracted by the grotesque, frankly fantastic character and subject matter.$ But once Renfield had crossed Dracula's cobwebby threshold, fantastic and uncanny themes would no longer be taboo in the American cinema.$ A virtual land rush would follow at Universal and other studios, with Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Mummy, and so many others.$ This extraordinary set, magnified to soaring heights by another glass painting, was constructed on Universal's Stage 12, a facility still in use today.$ The 18ft-wide spider web was constructed on a wire framework, built up with filaments of rubber cement shot from a rotary gun, like cotton candy.$ Dracula's first appearance is much more theatrical in the Spanish versión, but the simplicity of Stoker's introduction of the count is also worth consideration.$ Quote:"...I heard a heavy step approaching from beyond the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light."$ " Then there was the sound of chains and the clanking of bolts drawn back."$ " A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back."$ " Within stood a tall old man, clean-shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour."$ I am Dracula.$ "' Welcome to my house!$ Enter freely and of your own will!"$ " He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone."$ I bid you welcome.$ " The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength that made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice -$ more like the hand of a dead than a living man."$ Listen to them - children of the night.$ What music they make!$ It is fashionable in recent adaptations of Dracula to modify this famous line to:" what sad music they make" or" what sweet music they make", but Lugosi intones it with just the note of malevolent ambiguity that Stoker originally intended.$ Today, Dracula would probably have walked through the spider web with the aid of some digital effect, but consider how much more chilling it is not to see the action.$ Prompted by what is unseen, we complete the uncanny event in our minds.$ As shot, Dracula's following line originally began, quote:$ " The eternal struggle for life, each living creature must have blood to live."$ The spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.$ The blood is the life, Mr Renfield.$ Dracula is quoting from Deuteronomy 12.23, an injunction against consuming blood, one of many explicit and implicit biblical references in Stoker.$ I'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting.$ The sound technicians didn't find Dracula's chambers hospitable at all.$ According to studio publicity, this scene was delayed for hours, at some expense, until the loud crackling of the fire logs died down.$ Bela Lugosi, whose real name was Béla Blaskó, was born in Lugos, Hungary, in 1882.$ He became fascinated with the theatre at an early age, much to his parents' disappointment, and worked in provincial productions, and finally secured a company position with the national theatre in Budapest.$ Contrary to some accounts, he played mainly minor roles at the national theatre, a source of endless frustration for him.$ Postwar political upheaval and his activities as a unión organiser forced him to flee his homeland in 1919.$ He worked in German films before coming to the United States in 1920 to look for more rewarding work as a stage actor.$ He learned many of his English-language roles phonetically, resulting in the deliberate, oddly-inflected diction we now forever associate with Count Dracula.$ Curiously, this is another characteristic at odds with Stoker's vampire, who took great pains to speak English without any trace of an accent.$ You may notice a continuity jump, as Renfield's valise suddenly leapt from Dracula's hands flat onto the table.$ Dracula's enquiry as to whether Renfield has destroyed all his correspondence has been cut, resulting in an abrupt edit.$ Another line, cut from an earlier script, would have revealed Renfield as the sole proprietor of his real-estate practice, and therefore unlikely to be missed in the event of his disappearance.$ I hope I've brought enough labels for your luggage.$ I am taking with me only three... boxes.$ In the novel, Dracula takes no chances.$ He packs 50 wooden boxes with his native soil.$ Here are some more of Stoker's original descriptions of the count.Quote:$ " His face was a strong - a very strong - aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils;$ with lofty, domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the face and temples, but profusely elsewhere."$ " His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, with bushy hair that curled in its own profusión."$ " The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth."$ Stoker's Dracula also has pointed ears, pointed fingernails, hair growing in his palms, and bad breath to boot.$ The finger-cutting sequence is taken directly fromFW Murnau's 1922 German film Nosferatu, an unauthorised adaptation of Dracula, which Universal studied closely.$ The editing here reveals another continuity jump.$ Renfield's bed is suddenly turned down, although Dracula has not had the time to perform the courtesy.$ One of the most famous lines in Dracula is not taken from the novel or the play, but is original to the Universal film.$ When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977, the line was added to the script, presumably because audiences have come to expect it.$ I never drink... wine.$ Notice how many religious images have come together in this scene.$ The churchlike architecture.$ Dracula's ritualistic demeanour before an altarlike table.$ The partaking of bread, wine and blood.$ The display of a crucifix.$ A very unusual, nearly 180-degree camera move.$ Incidentally, this is not the first time Dwight Frye had acted with Bela Lugosi.$ They had appeared together, along with Fredric March, in the Broadway comedy The Devil in the Cheese in 1926.$ But after Dracula, both Lugosi and Frye would find comedy roles few and far between.$ The novel Dracula is full of Shakespearean allusions, and Dracula's three wives, as imagined by Stoker, are likely inspired by the weird sisters in Macbeth.$ In addition to Geraldine Dvorak, the other actresses are Dorothy Tree and Cornelia Thaw, whose real name was Mildred Pierce.$ Another continuity lapse.$ In the script,$ Renfield makes the fatal mistake of removing the crucifix, an action explicit in the Spanish versión.$ Here, the shot, if filmed, seems to have been deleted.$ In the approved shooting script and in the Spanish versión,Renfield is attacked by Dracula's wives and not by Dracula himself.$ In a later script, though not the shooting script, a wonderful effect is proposed:$ that the camera be placed on the floor in Renfield's helpless position as the ghostly faces of the women descend upon him.$ The visión of Dracula repelling the women and claiming the male visitor for himself is one of the earliest images that fired Bram Stoker's imagination.$ It brings to completion the uneasy atmosphere of homoerotic seduction that has coloured the entire sequence.$ In Bram Stoker's own theatrical adaptation, which he presented as a staged reading in 1897,$ Dracula goes so far as to sweep the unconscious visitor up into his arms and carry him into the shadows, much like Rhett Butler's rape of Scarlett O'Hara.$ In the modernised stage play upon which the film is largely based,$ Dracula makes his risky journey to England in an aeroplane, leaving Transylvania at dusk and arriving at Wimbledon aerodrome before dawn.$ Fritz Stephani suggested that the plane have wings shaped like those of a bat.$ This approach was wisely avoided.$ Due to budget constraints, the sequence was constructed from footage taken from a Universal silent called The Storm Breaker.$ The jerky, speeded-up appearance of the film is the result of silents being shot and projected at a slower speed than talkies.$ Like Renfield, and because of Renfield,$ Dwight Frye himself would soon be transformed into a lunatic, at least from the standpoint of Hollywood casting directors, who, after Dracula, had little use for Frye's demonstrated versatility as a Broadway character actor.$ Also in 1931, James Whale cast him in another demented role, that of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant Fritz, in Frankenstein.$ Thereafter, Frye found himself in a very narrow career groove, but, luckily for film fans, he gave some of the most enjoyable performances in the entire Universal canon.$ Had this scene followed the script and not been made from stock footage, we would have been treated to the following:$ " Large close-up.$ Dracula, fangs bared."$ " Medium shot.$ Sailor vaulting over the rail into the sea."$ " Close-ups ad lib, to be worked out in detail later, ending with a huge and impressive shot of Dracula, arms upraised, dark cloak billowing in the gale, about to close in on a screaming helpless wretch he has cornered."$ The voice of the harbour master is that of Dracula's director, Tod Browning.$ Born Charles Albert Browning in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1880,Browning got a start in show business via travelling carnivals and freak shows, for which he had a morbid fascination long after he became one of the highest-paid directors in Hollywood.$ Browning's films are filled with outsiders and misfits, and disturbing images of physical deformity.$ He forged a winning partnership in the 1920s with Lon Chaney, the famous" Man of a Thousand Faces", who was similarly drawn to themes of mutilation and disability.$ Universal hoped to have Chaney work with Browning on Dracula, where the actor's skill as a make-up artist would likely have created a Dracula very much unlike the one we've come to know, but Chaney was stricken with terminal cancer before a contract was finalised.$ This legendary shot was not scripted, and resulted from an inspired improvisation between Frye, Browning and Freund.$ Frye's son, also named Dwight, told me that he is still startled from time to time by waiters and sales people who, recognising his name on a credit card, spontaneously regale him with imitations of his father's otherwise inimitable laugh.$ The inclusión of this newspaper is the film's closest echo of Stoker's use of accumulated documents to tell his story:$ journals, diaries, letters and clippings.$ Stoker modelled his shipwreck on an actual maritime disaster, and probably got the idea of a vampire arriving on a storm-tossed ship$ from an 1847 penny-dreadful novel called Varney the Vampire.$ The sound of traffic is the first inkling we are seeing a film set in the 20th century.$ An interesting bit of scripted action was cut here, though possibly shot.$ There is no parallel scene in the Spanish versión.$ Quote:" He nods slowly, indicating that he'll take a flower, and makes a sign that she is to place it in his buttonhole."$ " She selects a flower, and with a half-timid, half-coquettish air starts to obey."$ " Camera moves forward to a large close-up of her face, as her eyes start to move in a dizzy, circular movement under the spell of Dracula's hypnotic stare."$ The shooting script also described Dracula parting his lips to reveal fanglike teeth.$ I'm virtually certain the flower girl was played by a young actress, Anita Dardour, who did not much longer pursue a Hollywood career, but later, under her married name, Anita Harder, was active in Santa Barbara community theatre,where she enjoyed recounting being Bela Lugosi's first victim outside Transylvania.$ The script has a description here of a moving camera shot worthy of Karl Freund that was never quite realised.$ Through dense fog, which starts slowly to clear, brilliant lights appear, and the crowd becomes denser.$ We see men in top hats and the gleam of white shoulders, the richness of furs.$ Music was used sparingly in early talkies, limited to title sequences and scenes where music was actually performed.$ We just heard a snippet of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, followed rather abruptly by the Prelude to Wagner's Die Meistersinger.$ The film's opening-title music is from Act Two of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, which became a trademark for Universal's early horror films.$ It also opens Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Mummy.$ And here we meet the rest of the principal supporting cast.$ From left to right, Helen Chandler as Mina Seward, David Manners as John Harker,$ Herbert Bunston as Dr Seward, and Francés Dade as Lucy Weston.$ Dracula movies tend to be very class-conscious.$ The aristocratic vampire invariably dominates working-class characters:$ maids, nurses, and other economically subservient women.$ By 1931 the Depressión had drawn sharp lines between the haves and have-nots, and perhaps this accounts for some of the film's fascination for audiences then.$ It is very puzzling how Karl Freund could have set up such a badly composed shot, with Dracula standing outside and below the box.$ It was probably this shot that led one Cleveland reviewer to conclude in print that Lugosi must be an actor of very short stature.$ The young performers- Helen Chandler, David Manners and Francés Dade - had only brief careers in Hollywood, and all for very different reasons.$ In Stoker's novel and the stage adaptations, Carfax is only a house, but in the Universal film it becomes, for the first time, an abbey.$ It is a stand-in, obviously, for Whitby Abbey, a ruin on the North Yorkshire coast that Stoker knew well, and features prominently in the first portion of his novel.$ Francés Dade came from a prominent Philadelphia family, acted in stock, and toured with the stage production of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in the late' 20s, before her short fling with Hollywood.$ Her first film was Raffles, with Ronald Colman.$ In a later script draft, this exchange with Dracula takes place at Lucy's home, where she has just given a harp recital.$ Dade returned to Philadelphia in the mid -' 30s, married, and at the time of her death in the 1960s, was reported to have been working as a nurse.$ A curious landmark moment, as Helen Chandler gives the first vocal imitation of Lugosi as Dracula on record.$ No one dreamed then that Lugosi's voice would become one of the most imitated and instantly recognisable in Hollywood history.$ In real life, Chandler and Dade were the closest of friends.$ Chandler had acted professionally from age eight, and had an impressive list of stage credits in New York.$ She had played one of the young princes in John Barrymore's Richard III, and appeared as Ophelia in Horace Liverwright's modern-dress Hamlet.$ Just prior to Dracula, she appeared in the screen adaptation of Sutton Vane's dramaOutward Bound, about a ship whose passengers don't yet realise they're dead and sailing toward judgment.$ Chandler seemed to have a promising career ahead, but she also had her own private vampire - alcohol -$ which would very soon begin to destroy her, personally and professionally.$ An alternate take of this shot with Lugosi, along with many others, can be seen in the Spanish versión, where they were used as a cost-cutting measure.$ Although bats have long been associated with the supernatural,$ Bram Stoker was the first writer to suggest a human vampire's literal transformation into a vampire bat.$ The association of vampires with werewolf transformations, however, had long been established in folklore and literature.$ Here is the scene's description before being toned down for the shooting script.$ Quote:" She has given up reading and is lying back, eyes closed as if dreaming."$ " A slight smile plays upon her lips."$ " She breathes evenly, and as her head lies back we see her beautiful white throat and a suggestion of her well-formed bosom."$ And moments later, as Dracula approaches for the kill, quote:$ " His lips part and his head bends nearer to her throat."$ " The teeth seem to have an almost canine appearance, as his mouth is about to touch her neck." Unquote.$ The Spanish film also avoids fangs, but more effectively ends the scene with Dracula pulling his cape over his sleeping victim like a shroud.$ In the novel, Lucy took weeks to die.$ In Hollywood, Dracula worked much more efficiently.$ More moving camera work from Freund, this shot made with an hydraulic crane, also used by cinematographer George Robinson for the dramatic staircase appearance of Dracula in the Spanish versión.$ The ward attendant is Charles Gerrard, an actor who had appeared the previous year, along with David Manners, in the film of RC Sheriff's acclaimed Worid War I drama Journey's End.$ The director, James Whale, would soon be recruited by Universal, where he would eclipse Tod Browning, with an incomparable flair for films like$ Frankenstein, The Old Dark House and The Invisible Man.$ Browning never seemed comfortable with talkies or with directing dialogue, whereas Whale had the advantage of being a stage director at a time when Hollywood was actively recruiting new talent from theatre.$ Here we are introduced to the unorthodox scientist Professor Van Helsing, played by the character actor Edward Van Sloan.$ Like Lugosi, Van Sloan created this part in the original Broadway production.$ The producers had seen him portray a psychiatrist in a drama by Franz Werfel, and thought he would be perfect.$ He told a reporter that he had never been in a play that ran more than a few weeks, but the New York and road-show versions of Dracula kept him occupied for 22 months.$ We are dealing with the... undead.$ Nosferatu!$ Yes, nosferatu.$ " Nosferatu" is a word Stoker found in a book by the Scottish folklorist Emily Gerard, called The Land Beyond the Forest, the literal meaning, by the way, of the word" Transylvania".$ Gerard mentioned that" nosferatu" was the Romanian term for vampire, and Stoker took her word for it.$ He used the word authoritatively in his novel, and it was further popularised as the title of FW Murnau's unauthorised film adaptation of 1922.$ The problem is," nosferatu" cannot be found in any dictionary or lexicon,Romanian or otherwise.$ Its real meaning and derivation, therefore, are matters of conjecture and mystery.$ Dr Seward is played by Herbert Bunston, who reprises his Broadway role.$ Born in England, Bunston made his London stage debut in 1897, coincidentally the year of Dracula's first publication.$ He's the only person connected with the 1931 film who also had a connection with Bram Stoker, who was acting as general manager of Sir Henry Irving's Royal Lyceum Theatre when Bunston performed there at the turn of the century.$ Bunston died in 1935.$ With this scene, the pacing of the film slows considerably.$ So, as Dr Seward and Professor Van Helsing discuss vampire superstition,I'll give a fuller outline of the genesis of Stoker's novel in folklore and literature, and its transformations via the theatre that resulted in the classic film we are now watching.$ Legends of spirits who return from the dead to drain the blood of the living are as old as recorded history.$ It is Eastern European folklore that most informs Dracula, but the image of the vampire as a decadent, predatory aristocrat is not part of the folklore tradition at all.$ Rather, it derives from Romantic literature, in particular a short story called The Vampyre by John Polidori, published in 1819.$ Polidori was the physician and travelling companion of Lord Byron, whose scandalous personal life was the inspiration for Polidori's supernatural lady-killer, Lord Ruthven.$ Polidori's story inspired seven stage plays and two operas in the 19th century, and their influence on Dracula is considerable.$ Novelist Bram Stoker was born just outside of Dublin in 1847.$ He was a sickly child, and one can't read about his early life without being reminded of all the anxious sickbed scenes in Dracula.$ Stoker overcame childhood illness, attended Trinity College, and afterward became a civil servant.$ But his real passión was the theatre.$ While working as an unpaid drama critic for a Dublin paper, he met a rising English actor-manager named Henry Irving.$ Stoker was overwhelmed with Irving's charisma, and devoted his professional life for the next three decades to managing Irving's company and its base of operations, the Lyceum Theatre.$ Almost all commentators on Stoker have noted his slavish devotion to Irving, a relationship that virtually eclipsed his own marriage.$ Given the fact that Stoker was publishing vast amounts of fiction on the side, it is difficult to imagine what time for a domestic or personal life he had at all.$ One is tempted to find an echo of his professional bondage in Dracula:$ the Lyceum as the castle and Henry Irving as the count,Stoker as the imprisoned Jonathan Harker.$ In fact, Stoker sorely wanted Irving to play Dracula on the Lyceum stage.$ Like Polidori, Stoker also seems to have intended his vampire as a backhanded tribute to a difficult, controlling benefactor.$ He spent nearly six years researching, writing and revising Dracula, apparently in the hope of achieving a creative collaboration with Irving, not just a business partnership.$ In our documentary supplement you can see Stoker's working notes for Dracula, as well as some photos of Henry Irving.$ Irving, however, spurned Stoker's efforts to recruit him as a vampire.$ A Chicago drama critic recalled Stoker's complaints during one of Irving's tours.$ Quote:" When the late Bram Stoker told me he had put endless hours in trying to persuade Henry Irving to have a play made from Dracula and act in it, he added that he had nothing in mind save the box office."$ "' lf', he explained,'I am able to have my name on the book, the governor can afford, with business bad, to have his name on the play."'$ "' But he laughs whenever I talk about it, and we have to go out and raise money to put on something in which the public has no interest."' End quote.$ Stoker went on to describe Irving as Dracula as a composite of the actor's celebrated villains:$ Mephistopheles in Faust,$ Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, and many others.$ In his earliest outlines, Stoker structured his story like a Shakespearean play, in five acts, or" books" as he called them.$ The vampire's name was originally Count Vampyre, until Stoker came across a reference to the ferocious 15th-century warlord named Vlad Tepes, popularly known as Dracula, meaning" son of the devil".$ Although Stoker did little research into the historical Dracula, appropriating the name was one of his greatest inspirations.$ Back to the film for a scene or two.$ There is controversy about the degree of Tod Browning's control over the film.$ David Manners told me personally that Browning directed none of his scenes, that the production was disorganised, and that his only direction came from cameraman Karl Freund.$ Freund must have been very distracted with extra responsibilities for this scene.$ Notice the very ragged piece of cardboard some grip has obviously used to shield the practical lamp for a close-up.$ Notice how it never goes away, even for the long shots.$ One gets the feeling no one is in the director's chair or behind the viewfinder.$ In fairness to Browning, even a more polished director like Whale was capable of things just as sloppy.$ In our special edition of Frankenstein, see the operating-table shot, where a sheet has fallen off the monster's draped form, revealing someone's neatly polished dress shoe.$ But back to Dracula.$ At the time Helen Chandler made this film, she was married to screenwriter Cyril Hume, who would eventually write the science-fiction classic Forbidden Planet.$ The marriage failed quickly.Chandler next married the actor Bramwell Fletcher, best remembered by Universal horror fans as the young archaeologist who goes out of his mind after reviving Boris Karloff in The Mummy.$ This marriage crumbled, as she began a self-destructive spiral of drink, drugs and periodic commitment to sanitariums.$ By 1935, her film career was essentially over.$ She fell out of public view until 1950, when, heavily sedated with sleeping pills, she was badly burned in a Hollywood bedroom fire, bringing a flurry of lurid press attention.$ The world never heard from her again.$ She died in 1965, following surgery for massively bleeding ulcers.$ She was cremated, but her ashes were never claimed.$ The novel Dracula was a departure from previous vampire stories, plays, operas, in that Stoker did not romanticise Dracula, and our 20th-century image of the count is a hybrid of Stoker's character and vampires from other literary sources.$ Stoker's Dracula engenders disgust rather than attraction, and is an amalgam of qualities that late-Victorian England found repulsive.$ There was a strong current of cultural xenophobia in the 1890s, and many Britons felt threatened by waves of immigration.$ Foreigners were frequently viewed as a threat to cultural and racial purity, and demonised as biologically degenerate, according to a distorted understanding of the theories of Charles Darwin.$ Dracula himself is a perfectly Darwinian monster, changing shape up and down the evolutionary scale.$ He is an invading foreigner, with a strong anti-Semitic coloration, much like Shylock, Fagin or Svengali.$ How long have you had those little marks?$ Marks?$ Examination of the skin for telltale marks was a common anxiety ritual for sexually active Victorians.$ Stoker may have been less familiar with" the blood is the life" as a biblical quote, than as an advertising tag line for a quack remedy for" bad blood", a euphemism for syphilis.$ Some scholars argue that Stoker may have suffered from tertiary syphilis, then untreatable, which could have hastened his death in 1912.$ The novel offers many strange reflections of other Victorian sexual anxieties as well.$ Many Victorian men were disturbed by the growing assertiveness of women.$ The concept of the" new woman" was routinely mocked and vilified in the mainstream press as monstrous and degenerate.$ In Dracula, women's sexuality is shown as a kind of evolutionary throwback linked to blood contamination by a foreigner.$ The lusty vampire women in Dracula are caricatures of Victorian prostitutes, who were popularly scapegoated as vectors of venereal disease and the destruction of the middle-class family.$ Dracula's first two screen appearances were not authorised by Stoker's widow.$ The first, in fact, probably escaped her notice.$ Dracula's Death, directed in Hungary by Károly Lajthay in 1921, concerned a musician, committed to an insane asylum, who believes he is the immortal vampire.$ He makes the mistake of inviting someone to fire a bullet at him, hoping to prove his immortality.$ Dracula's Death only used the name, but, the following year in Germany, FW Murnau directly adapted Stoker's novel asNosferatu, a Symphony of Horror, featuring a Dracula more repulsive than anything Stoker envisioned, half-human and half-rat.$ Although Nosferatu disguised the character names,Bram Stoker's widow convinced the German courts to declare the film a plagiarism and order all prints destroyed.$ Fortunately for film history, several copies did survive, and Nosferatu is now considered an Expressionist classic.$ The scene with the mirror originated in Stoker's novel, when Jonathan Harker, interrupted by Dracula while shaving, cannot see the count's reflection in his shaving glass.$ The vampire, of course, reacts violently.$ In the Deane / Balderston versión,$ Van Helsing makes the discovery in a wall-hung mirror, which Dracula shatters with a vase.$ In Deane's earlier stage versión, apparently as a budgetary measure,$ Dracula only started to hurl the vase, but then thought better, saving his producer the cost of replacing an expensive prop for every performance.$ Mirrors traditionally have many deep connections with the supernatural.$ After all, mirror reflections split us into two aspects, and" the double" was always associated with the dark side of human nature, the side we don't want reflected.$ In the Spanish versión, Dracula intensifies the mirror smashing by using his cane.$ Although we now regard Dracula as a quintessential screen icon, modern Dracula image is, in fact, largely a creation of the legitimate theatre.$ When Deane wrote and produced the first authorised stage versión in 1924, he introduced a radically reconstituted Dracula, a suave man about town, who actively ingratiates himself into the lives of the other characters.$ Deane added the accent that Stoker's Dracula had worked so hard to overcome, as well as the now trademark evening clothes and satin-lined cape, trappings borrowed from the familiar, faintly Mephistophelian persona of the standard stage magician.$ Deane originally planned to play Dracula, but soon realised that Van Helsing had all the good speeches, so he took the role of the professor.$ Beyond giving Dracula some manners and a new wardrobe,$ Deane completely eliminated Stoker's Transylvania scenes and restructured the story as a modern drawing-room mystery melodrama, that could utilise stock scenery, and not require the expense of period costumes.$ Deane's play toured Britain for three years before taking residence at the Little Theatre, a well-known haunt for horror and mystery plays in London's West End.$ As a publicity stunt, audiences were greeted by a nurse in the lobby, on hand to administer smelling salts to the faint of heart.$ The public loved it, but the snootier London critics were not kind, and reserved special brickbats for the play's more mechanical contrivances.$ From the Daily Telegraph, quote:$ " If you shout loudly or strangely enough, and if only you can contrive to make the sound unexpected, somebody is sure to be terrified."$ " In that sense, at least, this piece displays a sure sense of the theatre."$ " There is very little of Bram Stoker in it, but most of us jumped in our seats at least once in every act." End quote.$ Deane's play was more than a little hammy, but it was noticeable for introducing many of the fixtures we associate with Dracula:$ swirling capes, swirling mists,French windows, secret panels, and, perhaps most memorably, easily-hypnotisable maids, who can be relied upon to remove a variety of annoyances, ranging from crucifixes to garlic flowers to noxious necklaces of vampire-repelling wolfbane.$ The American stage rights were secured by the publisher-producer H Liverwright, a flamboyant showman, ever on the prowl for sensational properties.$ Rewritten for Broadway by playwright-journalist John L Balderston,$ Dracula opened in New York in October 1927.$ When the West End Dracula, Raymond Huntley, turned down the Broadway part in a salary dispute,$ Liverwright, unable to afford a name performer, offered the role to the relatively unknown Hungarian expatriate actor Bela Lugosi, despite Lugosi's shaky command of English.$ Balderston recalled that Lugosi had to be directed in French as a compromise.$ Lugosi was an imposing presence in the part.$ Liverwright insisted on adding touches of sickly eroticism.$ Lugosi wore bilious green make-up as he bestowed a languorous kiss, before baring his victim's throat for the main course.$ In the film, any suggestion of vampire foreplay is completely eliminated.$ As in London, nurses and fainting patrons were both provided by the management.$ A conflict of interest, perhaps, but one which drew no serious complaint.$ Hollywood studios had long toyed with the idea of filming Dracula, but were put off by the horrifying subject, and many studio readers considered it unfilmable for reasons of censorship.$ What have you to do with Dracula?$ Dracula?$ Dwight Frye may well have regretted ever having heard the name Dracula, given the effect it had on his career.$ Though the roles he was offered after Dracula and Frankenstein may have been beneath his real talents, he gave wonderfully loony performances in such films as The Vampire Bat,$ Bride of Frankenstein, and Dead Men Walk.$ A devout Christian Scientist, who hid a serious heart condition from his friends and family, he died on a Los Ángeles public bus in 1943.$ The maid, played by Moon Carroll, is misidentified on the film's main titles as Joan Standing.$ Standing actually plays the nurse Briggs, who will soon attend the ailing Mina.$ This creepy scene of Renfield crawling toward the maid is not what it seems.$ For some reason, the scene ends prematurely.$ What happens to the maid is never explained.$ For the surprising answer to this mystery, refer to the parallel scene in the Spanish versión.$ When Dracula made its debut on Broadway in October 1927,Universal sent a representative to the opening-night performance.$ He filed the following evaluation.Quote:$ " So far as the picture value of the story goes, nothing has changed."$ " Dracula is and always has been material for a great picture."$ " Great opportunity for actors, writers and director."$ " Great opportunity for photography of a wonderful sort and nature."$ " While it is picture material from the angle of the pictorial and dramatic, it is not picture material from the standpoint of the box office, nor of ethics of the industry."$ " It would be a thing which no child and, for that matter, no adult of delicate or nervous temperament should see, a thing beside which The Cabinet of Dr Caligari would seem like a pleasant fireside reverie." End quote.$ Dracula ran for 33 weeks on Broadway, followed by two simultaneous American tours, one with Bela Lugosi, and the other with Raymond Huntley, the original London Dracula.$ Lugosi luckily played the part in Los Ángeles, home of the film industry.$ Studio executives, afraid of the novel, realised that the tamer thrills of the stage play might be screenworthy after all.$ Following two years of often tempestuous negotiations between Bram Stoker's widow, Hamilton Deane,$ John L Balderston and their agents, and the studios of Universal,$ Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, and Fox Films,Universal purchased the film rights to the novel and stage adaptations for $ 40,000 in the summer of 1930.$ This scene shows another puzzling lapse of directorial judgment, or perhaps just pressure from the front office to keep the production moving.$ The shot runs nearly four minutes without a cut.$ When David Manners returns, he will have nothing to do but stare at Helen Chandler, waiting in vain for a close-up or reaction shot that never arrives.$ I had the pleasure of making David's acquaintance during his last years, and I remember him saying how much he disliked film acting as against the stage.$ He complained that the studios treated actors like mechanical props, not artists.$ He was annoyed at being given chalk marks on the floor for positioning, and hated filming scripts out of sequence.$ As a Broadway actor, he felt the performer controlled the drama.$ But in Hollywood actors sometimes weren't even told what was going on.$ Although it's not apparent on screen, in the days of slow film stocks sets like this were lit with huge arc lights, which could be painful for the actors, especially when shooting was going slowly, as it did on Dracula.$ David Manners' real name was Rauff Aklom.$ He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1901, began a stage career in the 1920s, before switching to film.$ A year before Dracula he appeared in seven pictures, including Journey's End, directed by James Whale.$ He is also remembered for appearing in other Universal horror and mystery films, including The Mummy, The Black Cat, and The Mystery of Edwin Drood.$ His six unhappy years in Hollywood came to an end, he told me, when Joan Crawford hysterically screamed obscenities at him for having the temerity to turn down a script.$ He told me he simply knelt down, placed the script silently at the screaming Crawford's feet, and left, never looking back.$ After retiring from Hollywood, he ran a guest ranch in the desert, published a few novels, and in his later years devoted his life to spiritual pursuits, and well into his nineties published a newsletter of metaphysical reflections.$ He died in 1998, at the age of 97.$ Bela Lugosi was not the studio's first choice for Dracula.$ Trade papers had suggested the Austrian actor Conrad Veidt, who had played the vampirelike sleepwalker in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari.$ But Universal's president, Carl Laemmle, insisted that the part be played by silent superstar Lon Chaney, whose fame for grotesque characterisations would provide box-office insurance for the risky property.$ Chaney had proven difficult and temperamental for Universal in the past, but his films did make money.$ Negotiations got as far as Universal's offer of a three-picture deal, including a talking sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, but Chaney had already developed terminal cancer.$ His death in August 1930, at the age of 47, shocked the film world.$ Universal had already convinced Tod Browning, Chaney's director at MGM, to helm Dracula, and considered a flurry of other actors for the lead role.$ Paul Muni was screen-tested.$ His multiple characterisations in the film Seven Faces had briefly typed him as an heir to the mantle of the Man of a Thousand Faces.$ William Courtenay, lan Keith, and Chester Morris were also considered.$ Bela Lugosi had lobbied feverishly for the screen part, even corresponded with Stoker's widow to try to bring down the purchase price, but the studio showed little interest until all other possibilities had fallen through.$ Because he was not an established star, the studio felt confident that Lugosi could be signed cheaply.$ He accepted a take-it-or-leave-it offer of $ 500 a week for seven weeks of filming.$ It was a quarter of the salary commanded by David Manners as the juvenile lead, but Lugosi had succeeded against all odds in making the screen part his own, and the studio did, in fact, bill him as" the new Lon Chaney".$ A number of screenwriters worked on Dracula.$ Following the previously discussed Stephani was the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Louis Bromfield, who faithfully adapted Stoker's opening and closing sequences in Transylvania, cleverly reconciling discrepancies with the stage play by having Stoker's withered old man rejuvenate, through blood drinking,$ into the suave younger Dracula popularised in the theatre.$ Carl Laemmle Jr, who produced Dracula, had originally hoped for the project to be a lavish" superproduction", as Universal's A-pictures were then known.$ But Bromfield's panoramic adaptation would have bankrupted the studio.$ Virtually nothing remains of it in the final production.$ Dudley Murphy, followed by Garett Fort, completely reworked the script, adding all its famous set pieces, as well as Dracula's morbidly memorable lines.$ Director Tod Browning received credit on the shooting script, though his writing credit was taken from the titles, with Bromfield's and Murphy's.$ We can safely assume that it was Fort to whom we owe most thanks for Dracula.$ He was also the main screenwriting force behind Universal's Frankenstein, as well as Dracula's Daughter in 1936.$ Because Dracula was a transitional film, reflecting the late silent era as much as the early talkies, it presented special problems to the studio.$ Many theatres in early 1931 were still not wired for sound.$ The foreign market, especially Spanish - speaking countries, wanted talkies, but they wanted actors to speak in their native language.$ Dubbing in those days was considered cheating.$ You forget, Doctor, that madmen have great strength.$ Dracula has great strength, eh, Renfield?$ Words, words, words!$ Another Shakespearean quotation, this time from Hamlet, Act II, as Hamlet feigns madness to Polonius.$ Dracula was produced in three separate versions:$ the Browning-Lugosi talkie, of course, but also an intertitled silent versión for theatres still without sound capability.$ In our documentary supplement, we've re-created a scene from the silent versión following Universal's original cutting continuity.$ As impressive as the scene Renfield describes would have been, it would have been impossible in practice.$ Rats were simply considered" bad theatre" by industry censors.$ And I could see that there were thousands of rats...$ You'll note that those creatures scurrying about the Castle Dracula crypts weren't rats at all but opossums.$ More biblical references here.$ In St Matthew, chapter 4,$ Satan takes Christ and tempts him with glorious visions of the material world.$ Quote:" All these things I will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me." Unquote.$ By offering blood communion as a means to physical immortality,$ Dracula perversely takes on aspects of both Satan and Christ.$ All these will I give you, if you will obey me.$ What did he want you to do?$ That which has already been done.$ It is actually not clear at all what Renfield is doing for Dracula.$ In the novel he serves as a kind of psychic informer for the vampire on doings within the sanitarium.$ In traditional folklore, a vampire requires an invitation to enter a house, and the weak-minded Renfield is happy to make the overture.$ But in the stage and film versions, unlike the book,Dracula himself is quite adept at soliciting social calls.$ The most intriguing variant versión of Dracula is the Spanish-language film, shot simultaneously at night on the same sets, but with a completely different director, cinematographer, cast and crew.$ Van Helsing's confrontation with Dracula is a good demonstration of the divergent approaches taken by the English and Spanish versions.$ The Spanish film follows the shooting script, building suspense while intercutting scenes of Mina's seduction of Harker, while Van Helsing attempts to resist Dracula's hypnotic commands.$ As you can see, Browning's versión lets the sequences play independently.$ Both are valid cinematic techniques, but they demonstrate very different cinematic sensibilities.$ Many foreign-language versions were produced in Hollywood in the' 30s, but the Spanish versión of Dracula is unique in that it amounts to a full-fledged rival production, owing to the personalities and politics of Universal at the time.$ Despite Carl Laemmle Jr's name on the main title of the Spanish film, the de facto producer of this versión was Paul Kohner,$ Carl Laemmle Sr's ambitious young protégé and heir apparent, until Laemmle Sr turned over the studio to his far less experienced son as a 21st birthday present.$ Kohner was taken off the slate as producer of the English Dracula, for which he already had great plans.$ He had hoped that Paul Leni, director of Waxworks and The Cat and The Canary, would direct Dracula, with Conrad Veidt as the star.$ Instead, Kohner was relegated to foreign versions of Universal's domestic films.$ Meanwhile, he had fallen in love with the beautiful Mexican ingénue, Lupita Tovar, star of Universal's Spanish versión of The Cat Creeps, which he had also produced, and so effectively that Laemmle ordered sections of the American versiónreshot to match the atmosphere of the Spanish production.$ Kohner kept Tovar in Hollywood long enough to convince her to be his wife.$ The Spanish Dracula, included in this edition, along with a special introduction by Lupita Tovar Kohner, provides a rare opportunity to compare and contrast simultaneous studio interpretations of a single script.$ Under Paul Kohner, the Spanish crew was headed by director George Melford.$ Melford had previously directed Rudolph Valentino as The Sheik, effective preparation for the Spanish Dracula, a Latin lover if there ever was.$ Kohner, Melford, and cinematographer George Robinson reviewed Tod Browning's dailies and obsessively made their improvements.$ The actors, however, could not view the rushes, except for Carlos Villarías as Dracula, whom the studio wanted to appear as Lugosi-like as possible.$ Villarías' name was shortened to Carlos Villar on the main titles, and his contract for the film was further Americanised to Charles Villar.$ You can also spot him, once again in formal attire, in the opening scenes of Bordertown, with Bette Davis and Paul Muni, in 1935.$ Tod Browning was reportedly furious at being upstaged by Kohner's production, but the Spanish film displays more technical sophistication than Browning's.$ It lacks the poetry of Lugosi's majestic presence and unforgettable line readings, but visually often seems years ahead of its time.$ The overall effect is aided immeasurably by the quality of the master element, based on Universal's nearly pristine nitrate negative, save for the third reel, which had deteriorated beyond recovery, and was replaced by a multigenerational showprint found in Havana.$ Nitrate was a very unstable film stock, but its high silver content produced an extraordinary image, difficult to reproduce on safety film.$ Notice in the Spanish Dracula the deep velvety blacks and crystalline highlights evident everywhere throughout the film.$ Notice the special care given to lighting, especially the back lighting of spider webs and mist.$ Notice shots cut from the Browning film, including an extraordinary glass shot of Carfax Abbey perched on a cliff above a pounding sea.$ Notice George Robinson's use of the moving camera, inspired, no doubt, by Karl Freund but often eclipsing their inspiration.$ Notice how many times Lugosi appears in long shots and medium long shots:$ outtakes, not duplicates, from the Browning film.$ Lupita Tovar's negligees are much more revealing than those of Helen Chandler, and the rats are real, not stand-in opossums.$ Universal didn't have to worry about the censor for its non-domestic product.$ The Spanish film was produced at the amazing cost of $ 66,000, as compared to the $ 341,000 lavished on the English-language film.$ The English-language Dracula was premiered at New York's Roxy Theater on February 12, 1931.$ An oft-repeated story suggesting a Valentine's Day tie-in is without basis.$ The initial advertising campaign traded instead on the bogus moving back of the premiere from Friday 13.$ The film was a surprise hit across the country, and contributed to Universal having its one profitable year during the Depressión.$ According to David Manners, neither he or his co-star Helen Chandler took the filming of Dracula very seriously, and had to stifle laughter throughout the production.$ And there once more is the Karl Freund memorial piece of cardboard, which nobody in the film ever seems to notice.$ David Manners told me that Lugosi was particularly aloof and unapproachable, wrapped up in the Dracula mystique as he was wrapped up in his Dracula cape, walking in front of a full-length mirror intoning to himself$ " I am Dracula" over and over.$ David insisted that he had never even bothered to see Dracula, but I'm not sure I really believed him.$ He was, in any case, flabbergasted at the fan mail he continued to receive more than 60 years after the film's release.$ I hope I'm not making him out to be a curmudgeon.$ He was an elegant, accomplished and very charming man, but he never understood why, with all the things he had done in his long life, people only seemed to want to talk to him about Dracula.$ One of the more lurid passages in Stoker's novel involved Dracula feeding blood from a wound in his chest to Mina Harker as a mystical, quasi-sexual sacrament.$ Not surprisingly, Helen Chandler only describes the action, rather as Renfield described the rats.$ Deane had had trouble with the British stage censors over Mina's recollections.$ Here's dialogue the Lord Chamberlain's office considered beyond the pale.$ Quote:" I screamed out and fell on the floor."$ " I can remember his bending over me and - oh, my God, pity me!$ - he placed his reeking lips on my throat."$ " I have a vague memory of something very sweet all round me, and I seemed to be sinking into deep, green water.$ Everything went black."$ " How long this horrible thing lasted I don't know, but it seemed ages before I came to and saw him withdraw his awful sneering mouth."$ " And as I looked, it was dripping with fresh blood." Unquote.$ The most gruesome scene in Stoker's novel, the destruction of Lucy, is not shown in the English versión, and only briefly indicated in the Spanish versión.$ The shooting script makes matters much more clear.$ While Dracula is busy hypnotising the nurse and abducting Mina, intercut is a scene of Van Helsing and Harker visiting Lucy's graveyard, and they there observe her returning to her mausoleum.$ Quote:" As the door of the vault closes slowly with a faint creaking sound, behind Lucy and from somewhere near at hand an owl hoots."$ " Camera swings around to medium close shot of Harker and Van Helsing behind a tombstone, and we get over Harker's reaction to Lucy's appearance, which has left him speechless and shaken."$ " He stares at the closed door of the vault with an expressión of stupefaction, can't credit his senses."$ " There is a faintly pitiful look in his eyes, as if he almost suspected his own sanity."$ " Van Helsing does not speak.$ He studies Harker gravely, narrowly, watching to see the effect this has upon him, his manner paternal."$ " One hand goes out, steadying, to Harker's trembling shoulder."$ " For the first time we see that Van Helsing has an oblong paper-wrapped parcel."$ " He indicates parcel, pointing to vault, and says gravely:$ 'I would have spared you this but I wanted you to see for yourself."' End quote.$ The script cuts back to Dracula's abduction of Mina, returning to a shot of the churchyard, Lucy's vault in the foreground.$ Quote:" Through the open door there comes the sound of a heavy blow, followed by a piercing unearthly scream."$ " An owl, disturbed by the sound, flutters across the scene."$ " For a moment there is absolute silence, then slowly the figure of Harker appears, a ghastly, stricken look on his face."$ " He emerges and leans against the door of the vault, head bowed, body sagging."$ " Van Helsing follows, backing out, eyes looking back to the darkness of the vault."$ " Van Helsing, quote:' Driving that stake in her heart was an act of mercy."'$ "' May her soul rest in peace."' End quote.$ For both Tod Browning and Bela Lugosi, Dracula was a problematic milestone.$ It would be the most commercially successful film either would make, and yet for both of them it was a high point that would never be repeated.$ Browning made one more film for Universal, then returned to MGM, where he produced Freaks, which Irving Thalberg intended as the ultimate horror film.$ No other hits followed for Browning, though his 1935 Mark of the Vampire proved an atmospheric homage to his earlier triumphs, featuring Lugosi as a cloaked vampire bearing an uncanny resemblance to a certain Count You Know Who.$ Tired of studio politics, he directed his last picture,$ Miracles For Sale, in 1939, and then retired to Malibu and lived a comfortable, if reclusive, existence until his death in 1962.$ Due in part to the indelible impressión he made with the role,$ Bela Lugosi never escaped the shadow of Dracula, although he played the role on screen only one more time, in the 1948 comedy Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.$ His heavy accent hampered him, and his star in Hollywood was soon eclipsed by Boris Karloff's, who, by the time of Frankenstein's release at the end of 1931, was the new new Lon Chaney.$ Off screen and on, Lugosi looked and sounded like Dracula.$ It was his own face, after all, his own voice that he had given to the part, not the creation of the make-up department.$ In rare films like Son of Frankenstein in 1939,$ Lugosi was able to show his true versatility as a character actor, but these were only the exceptions that proved the typecasting rule.$ A long-standing medical addiction to painkillers became tabloid news in 1955, when Lugosi publicly sought treatment.$ A few years later, when Dracula was released to televisión and discovered by a new generation of fans,$ he might have had a twilight revival of his career.$ But he died on August 16, 1956, taking one of his beloved Dracula capes to the grave with him.$ In the novel, the destruction of Dracula took place after an exciting sea and land chase back to Transylvania.$ Just before sunset and just before reaching his castle, his earth box is thrown from a wagon and pried open by Jonathan Harker and his fatally wounded American compatriot Quincey Morris.$ According to Mina Harker, quote:$ " I saw the count lying with the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him."$ " He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well."$ " As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph."$ " But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife."$ " I shrieked as I saw it tear through the throat, whilst at the same moment Mr Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart."$ " It was like a miracle, but before our eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight."$ " I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there." End quote.$ In the film Nosferatu, Dracula was destroyed by the first rays of sunlight, which would have surprised Stoker, since his Dracula walked around London in broad daylight.$ In the first stage versión, Dracula was stabbed through the heart and evaporated into dust with the aid of a trick coffin, built on the principles of a magician's disappearing cabinet.$ For the Broadway versión, a wooden stake was substituted for the knife.$ But the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson complained, quote:$ " They kill him with one blow on a stake driven through his heart."$ " Several additional blows, given with a hearty grunt or two, would seem to be a good deal more conclusive."$ " Count Dracula deserves a steam hammer." Unquote.$ Unfortunately, Hollywood censors did not agree with Atkinson, and most of Dracula's death groans went unheard for nearly 60 years until Universal finally restored them on laser disc.$ As the actors took their bows during the curtain call of the stage versión, it was customary for Professor Van Helsing to step forward, raising his hand to stop the applause, and deliver a special message.$ Original cast member Ivan Butler told me that provincial audiences, familiar with the speech from repeated touring, eventually recited it aloud, as in a 1920s versión of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.$ It was included in the original release of the film, but the censors demanded its removal, fearful it might offend religious groups by encouraging belief in the supernatural.$ So, to get a better idea of exactly what Professor Van Helsing had to say,I suggest you visit our documentary supplement, The Road to Dracula, where we've done our best to re-create this lost cinematic moment.$ This is David Skal, and this was Dracula.$ " Among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the Borgo Pass are found crumbling castles of a bygone age."$ I say, driver, a bit slower.$ Oh, no!We must reach the inn before sundown.$ And why, pray?$ It is Walpurgis Night.$ The Night of Evil!$ Nosferatu!$ On this night, madam, the doors, they are barred, and to the Virgin we pray.$ I say, porter, don't take my luggage down.$ I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.$ No, no, please.$ Put that back up there.$ The driver, he is afraid- Walpurgis Night.$ Good fellow, he is.$ He wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.$ Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.$ -

who the girl is...$ Gerry, let her alone.$ Go on, Joan.Go on to Westbury.Marry the man you love.$ Why, you girls ought to be ashamed of yourselves.Quarreling like this?$ Goodbye, Joan.$ I just

just isn't in him.$ Oh, if Joan only knew him as I know him.$ Hello, darling.$ Hello, darling.$ Ten o'clock, the little church around the corner then your house for food.$ I'm no fool.$ Say, how much should I give the minister?$ Whatever you think it's worth, I suppose.$ I couldn't afford to pay that much.$ What are you laughing at?$ The passports just got here.Oh, Tony, my picture!$ Is it dreadful?$ We're a great pair.$ We don't look as if we're trying to get out of the country.$ By the way, Gerry.$ I can't go to the Woodwards.$ I've got to run down to Washington, after all.$ That's

brave enough now.$ I think he's interested in Miss Trent.$ I like Joan, I like the sister.$ But that aunt...$ Oh, she seems alright.$ Come in.$ How do you do?$ Hello...$ When I met you today, Mr. Woodward,I don't think you remembered me.$ I'm the son of Timothy Collins.$ Buster Collins!$ Why, we knew you when you were that high.$ Now I'm this high.$ I came in here to ask you, Mr. Woodward... if you knew that Jim intended to marry Joan Trent.$ No, really?$ Well, we hadn't heard, but um...I should be really glad if it were true.$ We're anxious that Jim should settle down.$ But what do you know about these Trents?$ Nothing much.$ They seem to be nice people.$ Well, not from what I heard.$ But if you're satisfied, alright.$ Buster, one moment.$ Tell us what you heard.$ Oh, it doesn't matter much.$ It certainly does.$ Tell us what you know.$ Well, I heard... that the aunt... was a bootlegger.$ What did I tell you?$ Nonsense.$ I don't believe it.$ You may not believe that but that's

thought it was soup.$ Would you pass the sugar?$ Please.$ Sugar?$ Thank you.$ One, two...Three, four...$ Pardon me!$ Do you realize that's sugar?$ Oh, yes...$ Oh, yes, I've heard of that before.$ I'll bet you love it!$ Say when.$ When!$ When!$ What's the matter?$ What are you looking at?$ Nothing.$ What do you want?$ What's the matter?$ What are you laughing at?$ Aunt Kate, I have news for you.$ Mr. Woodward and you...Buffalo Bill.$ Why did you call me?$ I've hardly had a drop of my lunch.$ What do you mean by inviting these Trents to our house?$ They're crazy.$ Why, isn't the rest of our

No...What will they think downstairs?$ I don't care what they think.$ I have a bigger impulse.$ I want to stay.I haven't laughed like this in years, Gerry.$ I always did have a good time with you.$ Why talk about that?$ I'm just beginning to realize what a fool I was to let you get away from me.$ Are you trying to make love to me?$ That's the impulse.$ What about Joan?$ Joan will never be a Gerry.$ I think the only reason I ever fell for Joan in the first place was because she reminded me so much of you.$ Can't we start all over again?$ You mean it?$ I was never more serious in my life.$ Oh, Gerry...$ Just a moment.Let me think.$ I'd hate to hurt Joan any more than is necessary.$ Joan's just a kid.She'll get over it.$ I bet I know what you're thinking about.$ Blake.$ Oh, forget him.$ Don't you want me back?$ Isn't there a little spark still burning?$ Why do you suppose I was so anxious to break it up between you and Joan?$ Jealousy!$ What a fool I was not to have seen it before.$ You mustn't be too hasty, Jim.$ Wait.$ Oh, Gerry.$ Do you suppose it will work out?$ Will we ever recapture the happiness of the old times?$ We could.$ Remember the gay life, the music, the dancing?$

you.$ Well?$ Well, um...$ I think you'd sound more convincing with your coat on.$ No wonder you didn't want me to have him.You wanted him for yourself.$ Why, men like Jim have enough love for both of us.$ I won't share his love with anyone.$ Well, I guess you're going to have to choose between.$ Pick yourself a Trent.$ Wait, maybe this will help.Ippety-bippety-bippety-tap Ippety-bippety-bippetyKannaba.$ How does it go?$ Oh, stop it!$ Why do you hesitate?$ Is there any doubt?$ Of course there's a doubt.$ Jim's very fond of his Gerry, aren't you, Jim?$ Gerry, I don't know how you could do this to me.$ Joan, don't cry.$ Please.$ I know it hurts.But you'll soon forget.Really you will.$ There now, don't cry.Leave me alone.$ Don't touch me.$ Oh, Joan, I...I don't

darling?How about it?$ I'm beginning to understand you, Jim.$ You're not bad.You're just not very bright.$ Hello, Gerry.$ What's the matter?$ Sick?$ No, I'm alright.$ I talked to Joan this morning on the phone.And what do you think?$ She called me.$ Looks like everything's gonna be alright.$ Say, what happened out there the other night?$ Tony no more than got there and he left.$ And then you left.Then everybody left.$ So I left.$ Howdy, Joan.$ Buster, do you mind if I meet you down at the car?$ I want to talk to Gerry.$ Sure.See you soon, Gerry.$ I want to tell you, Gerry...I understand everything now.$ I'm sorry about Tony.$ I know you are.$ And I want to tell you that...$ Do you want me to stay home with you?$ I don't have to go out with Buster.$ I think it would be nice if you would.$ You'll be alright?$ I'll be home early.$ Oh, Miss Trent.I want you to see something wonderful.It's just come.$ Is this not beautiful?$ Are you going to stand around all day and admire that atrocity?$ You should be ashamed of yourself.$ I'm getting sick and tired of it.$ Why, Aunt Kate, what do you mean?$ Here you are in love with a man.Yet you sit around all day moping while he sails right out of your life.$ Are you sure he's sailing?$ Certainly, I called his house.$ You didn't.Of course I did.$ Why not?$ Shame on you!$ What did he say?$ Nothing.$ He wasn't there.$ But his servant

of the name of Trent, you'll get out of here and go after him.$ Seize your man, isn't it?$ You love him, don't you?$ Well, you're always preaching to me about obeying those instincts.$ Why don't you

if not 90% - of our leads are false.$ The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.$ They're constantly on call, always tense and alert, ever ready to spring into action, to follow even the slightest lead, as it just might be the one that solves the case.$ Mr. Secretary, just consider the search of the crime scene.$ To give you an example:$ In the bushes just behind a picket fence, a small, white, crumpled paper wrapping was found.$ It apparently once contained inexpensive sweets.$ In the outermost corner were found traces of fruit drops and particles of powdered sugar.$ We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half, but all to no avail.$ With each passing day we expand the area searched.$ But, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.$ Despite all these setbacks, we're forced to press on in our investigation, always in uncertainty, and with little chance of success in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.$ Our men are doing everyth -$ What good is all this?$ Commissioner, I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorizing 4 1 / 2 million people!$ And the police are getting nowhere!$ Mr. Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.$ Do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 1 5 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?$ Let me give you a random example:" Testimony 1, 47 8 in the Beckmann murder case..."$ -

We have our connections.$ What if we put an article in the papers that our syndicates - I mean, our organization - doesn't wish to be lumped in together with this pig, and that the cops should look for this guy somewhere else.$ He's not even a real crook!$ This man may well be - when not engaged in the actual act of killing -a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.$ In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.$ Without what I'll call the innocuousness of these murderers' private lives, it's inconceivable that someone like Grossmann or Haarmann could have lived right next door to their neighbors for years without arousing the faintest trace of suspicion!$ This is where we must focus the public's attention.$ The public must cooperate.$ I'll tell you about public cooperation!$ Just thinking of it makes me puke.$ I beg your pardon, Commissioner.$ But ain't it the truth?$ What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?$ Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!$ Very true.$ They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.$ That's right.$ But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.$ Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.$ There's your public cooperation for you!$ I believe you're exaggerating a bit, Lohmann.$ It can't really be that bad, can it?$ But it is, Commissioner!$ Most of the public still takes the position," How does this concern me?"$ The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!$ I've got another idea.$ There was this magician.$ Te- Tele - I can't remember what you call it.$ Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.$ The reward is still far too little money.$ The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.$ None of this is anything new.$ This is all leading nowhere.$ So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?$ The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.$ The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.$ The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.$ These children vanish without a trace.$ And when they're found...Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.$ And the perpetrator...$ It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.$ That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.$ The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.$ They'll only get him by accident now.$ - We can't wait for that.$ No, we'll go broke by then.$ What, then?$ We have to catch him... ourselves.$ Yes, that's what we must do.$ There is perhaps one other way.$ I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.$ Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.$ That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.$ We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.$ We must cover the city with a net of informers.$ Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.$ No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.$ - Fine, but how?$ - And who?$ It must be people who can go anywhere without causing a stir, follow anyone without attracting attention, follow any child to any house without arousing suspicion.In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.$ -

Anything else?$ - Not a thing, honey.$ Good night.$ - And lock the door as you go out.$ - Good night.$ $ 5,000 is a lot of money.$ You will please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.$ What are you doing, kidding me?$ You will please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.$ Okay, Doctor.$ I'm going to search your office, Mr. Spade.$ And if you attempt to prevent me, I shall certainly shoot you.$ Stand up, please.$ I must see that you're not armed.$ Why did you strike me after I was disarmed?$ I'm sorry.$ But you could imagine my embarrassment, Doctor, when I found your $ 5,000 offer to be nothing but a lot of baloney.$ You're mistaken.$ It was a genuine offer.$ I am prepared to pay you $ 5,000 for the statuette's return.$ - Do you have it?$ - No.$ If it's not in this office, why should you risk your life to prevent my searching for it?$ What do you expect me to do?$ Sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?$ I see you've got my apartment address.Have you been there, too?$ Yes.$ While I am ready to pay $ 5,000 for the statuette,I naturally wanted to save the owner that expense.$ Who is the owner?$ - I cannot answer that question.$ - What does this black bird look like?$ It's a figure, about 12 inches high, in black enamel.$ All right, it's a deal.$ But remember, you're not hiring me to go out and murder or steal.$ You simply want me to get the black bird for you in a lawful and honest way.Is that right?$ If possible.$ At least with discretion.$ Okay.$ I'm at the Hotel Belvedere if you should wish to communicate with me.$ Fine.$ - Good afternoon.$ - Good afternoon, Doctor.$ - May I have my gun, please?$ - Sure.$ Thank you.$ You will please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.$ I'm going to search your office, Mr. Spade.$ Go ahead and search, Doc.You're paying for it.$ Hello.$ Sorry I'm late.$ Been waiting long?$ I came over the moment I got your message.$ I saw your friend Cairo today.$ Do you know Cairo?$ Yes.$ He offered me $ 5,000 for the black bird.$ Surely you're not considering it?$ $ 5,000 is a lot of money.$ But, Mr. Spade, you promised to help me.$ I trusted you.$ Now, don't let's try to figure out how much you've trusted me.$ I promised to help you, sure, but you didn't say anything about any black birds.$ You won't...$ Why, you can't treat me like this.$ $ 5,000 is a lot of money.$ Yeah.$ It's more than I can afford to pay you for your loyalty.$ That's good, coming from you.$ Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?$ Well, if I'm peddling it, I'm selling to the highest bidder.$ I love your apartment, Sam.$ Don't you ever get lonesome?$ Sometimes.$ - Hello, Tom.$ - Hello.$ Hello.$ Saw your light.$ Thought we'd come up and talk to you.$ Go ahead and talk.$ Love of Mike, you're not gonna make us stand out here, are you?$ Afraid you'll have to, Tom.$ I can't let you in.$ So you won't play along with us.$ Still going it alone.$ Say, what's on your mind beside your hat?$ Just this, there's a lot of talk going around that you and Archer's wife were pretty thick.$ Any truth in it?$ No.$ There's even talk that's why he was put on the spot.$ Why don't you stop trying to be a hog, Dundy?$ You shouldn't try to pin more than one murder on me.$ - I haven't pinned anything on you.$ - I know you haven't.$ All you've done is sneak around here after hours$ - and ask me a lot of silly questions.$ - And get a lot of lying answers.$ Well, maybe you're right, bucking us.$ Think it over.$ Glad to see you anytime, Lieutenant.$ Drop around when I'm not so busy.$ I'll let you in.$ Any more of your tricks, and I'll finish you.$ What's all this?$ Maybe you can tell me.$ She hit me over the head.$ She would have killed me.$ What for?$ What did you do?$ Nothing!$ Nothing!$ On my word of honor.$ Well?$ Miss Wonderly, I'd like you to meet Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Sergeant Polhaus.$ Miss Wonderly is an operator in my employ.$ And an old college chum of mine,Dr. Cairo from back East.$ The two of them indulging in a friendly little argument, huh?$ - I can easily explain that, Lieutenant.$ - I'll bet you can.$ Miss Wonderly never saw Dr. Cairo before.$ And when he came into my apartment by the back way,$ - well, naturally, she was frightened.$ - Oh, I was.$ I was terribly afraid.$ And I'm so glad you aren't a burglar, Dr. Cairo.$ - You will forgive me, won't you?$ - Why, most certainly, mademoiselle.$ Why should your dear old college chum go and come through the back door?$ I'm sure, I don't know.$ Joel, why did you?$ Why, as a matter of fact, I have a large sum of money on me, and, naturally, I was alarmed at being trailed.$ I'm not usually timid, but in a strange city one never knows.$ If I may go with you when you leave, I'll feel much safer.$ Rather a brief visit, your old school friend is making.$ You won't mind, Sam, will you, if I go along with these gentlemen?$ Not at all, Joel.$ - Come and see me again sometime soon.$ - Why, I certainly will.$ I'm sorry this little thing happened.$ Oh, that's all right, that's all right.$ And Miss Wonderly, is she also afraid to go home in the dark?$ Miss Wonderly is taking some notes that I haven't finished as yet.$ I see.$ In that case, we'll leave you to your conference.$ - Good night.$ - Good night, Lieutenant.$ If those detectives are waiting outside for me, they're going to have a long wait.$ You can take my bedroom.$ I'll sleep out here.$ I hope I won't be putting you out.$ Are you comfortable, honey?$ Come on, dear, tell me all about that black bird.$ Oh, I'm so tired, Sam.$ Tired of everything, of myself, of lying, of thinking up lies until I don't know a lie from the truth.$ I wish I...$ Sam.$ Don't shoot, honey.$ It's only Sam the grocery man.$ - Where have you been?$ - I went down to get the groceries.$ I'm sorry I frightened you, babe.$ I'll get breakfast ready, if you run my bath for me.$ That's fair enough, sugar.$ - Hello, Sam.$ - Hello, Iva.$ How are you, honey?$ I'm glad to see you.$ I came to talk to you, Sam.$ - Can't I go in?$ - I'm very busy right now.$ Don't be silly.I came to talk to you, and I'm not going to stay out here.$ Come here.$ I saw her!$ Who's that dame wearing my kimono?$ Now behave yourself, honey.$ I suppose I haven't any right where you're concerned.$ Well, I thought I had.$ I thought your pretending to love me gave me some.$ Well, let's not talk about that now.What do you want?$ Just to talk to you, Sam.$ I must.$ I've got to.$ I haven't got the time.$ All right.$ If you won't listen to me, I know someone who will.$ Lieutenant Dundy might be interested in what I've got to say.$ I'll be seeing you.$ All quiet?$ Everything's under control, honey.$ You have a lot of trouble with your women, don't you, Sam?$ Here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.$ Okay.$ - A cigar, sir?$ - Thanks.$ - You're a close-mouthed man, sir.$ - No.$ - I like to talk.$ - We'll talk if you like.$ And I'll tell you right now that I'm a man who likes to talk to a man who likes to talk.$ Fine.$ - Let's talk about the black bird.$ - Splendid.$ Splendid.$ No beating about the bush, straight to the point.$ - Let's get to the point.$ - Yes, by all means.$ You are here, Mr. Spade, as Miss Wonderly's representative?$ No.$ I'm here looking out for myself.$ That's wonderful, sir.$ That's wonderful.$ I do like a man who says right off he's looking out for himself.$ Don't we all?$ Let's talk about the black bird, huh?$ Of course.$ Mr. Spade, have you any idea how much that little black bird is worth?$ I know it's valuable,$ - but I don't know what it is.$ - You don't know what it is?$ What do you know, sir, of the ancient Order of St. John of Jerusalem,$ - afterwards called the Knights of Rhodes?$ - Nothing much.$ - They were crusaders or something.$ - Right.$ And when the Emperor Charles gave the island of Malta to these crusading knights, he made the condition that each year they were to pay him the tribute of one falcon,in acknowledgment that Malta was still under Spain.$ - You understand?$ - Yeah.$ Sure.$ Have you any idea, sir, of the immense, the immeasurable wealth of the Order of St. John?$ As far as I can remember, they were pretty well-fixed.$ " They were pretty well-fixed."$ For years, they had taken the cream of the East as spoils of victory.$ We all know that to them the Holy Wars were merely a matter of loot.$ Holy Wars?$ I'll bet that was a great racket.$ The knights wanted to express their gratitude to the Emperor.$ So the bird they sent him for the first year's tribute wasn't an insignificant live bird, but a glorious, golden falcon encrusted with the finest jewels in their coffers.$ The finest, largest jewels out of Asia.$ - Those are historical facts, sir.$ - All right, all right.$ " All right," you say.$ But the falcon never reached the Emperor.$ Pirates captured the boat on which it was shipped to Spain and took the bird.$ I've traced the history of that bird all over Europe, sir.$ In 1840 it turned up in Paris.$ By that time, to hide its real identity, it was enameled over to look like nothing more than a fairly interesting statuette.$ - And it's still the same way?$ - Under that disguise, it was kicked around the gutters of Paris for 70 years.$ - And then what happened?$ - In 1911, a Greek found it and discovered its real value.$ His home was raided, and he was murdered.$ No one else knew what the bird was, and so it was lost again.$ - And it's still lost.$ - That was 20 years ago, sir.$ It took me that time to locate it, but I did it.$ I traced it to the home of a Russian in Constantinople.$ Kemidov.$ He wouldn't sell it.$ So I sent some agents to get it for me.$ They got it, and I haven't got it.$ So it doesn't belong to any of you.$ - It belongs to General Kemidov.$ - Belongs?$ You might as well say it belongs to the King of Spain.$ But I don't see how you can say it belongs to anyone, except by right of possession.$ - Then it belongs to Miss Wonderly now.$ - No, sir,$ - except as my agent.$ - Oh, I see.$ - You're sure she has it?$ - I'm not sure of anything.$ Yeah, but you know where to get it.$ At the right time and for the right price.$ Well, now, before we begin talking price, how soon can you deliver the falcon?$ - A couple of days.$ - That's satisfactory.$ Now, I have two proposals to make, sir.$ I will pay you $ 25,000 when you deliver the falcon to me, and another $ 25,000 when I get to New York.$ - That's one.$ - And the other?$ I will give you 25 ° / 0, one-quarter of what I realize on the falcon.$ Now, take your choice.$ Either an immediate $ 50,000, or a much greater sum within, say, a couple of months.$ - How much greater?$ - Who can tell?$ If I were to tell you the probable minimum, you'd call me a liar.$ No.$ Not even if I thought so.$ Well, what do you say, sir, to a half a million as your share?$ A half a million?$ And you really believe this bird is worth $ 2 million?$ Easily.$ All right, it's a deal.$ Now, Mr. Gutman, what about a deposit to cinch this deal?$ Oh, certainly.$ Certainly, sir.$ Why, what was I thinking?$ How about $ 1,000?$ Okay.$ Now I have your word that you won't back out.$ My word!$ You've got my $ 1,000 dollars, besides.$ The doctor is here.$ The doctor?$ Oh, yes.$ Oh, dear me.$ Excuse me, sir, I have a medical appointment.$ - Don't go away.$ - I'll be right here.$ I'll be right back.$ Joel, my boy.$ Does this mean that you've come back to the fold?$ Get rid of him.$ Why?$ I just offered him $ 25,000 for the falcon.$ And I offered him $ 5,000.$ We were both of us fools.$ - He hasn't got it.$ - He hasn't got it?$ Why, I just gave him a thousand bucks to bind the deal.$ He says he can get it within two days.$ - We can get it without him today.$ - How?$ - You remember Jacobi?$ Captain Jacobi?$ - Jacobi?$ I mentioned him in my report from Hong Kong.$ I wrote you I'd seen the Wonderly girl there with him.$ Jacobi.$ Yeah, I remember.$ - His boat was La Paloma.$ - Exactly.$ And look.$ Well, what's all this got to do with it?$ Oh, you don't connect it with the falcon in any way, huh?$ - Miss Wonderly has the falcon.$ - No, she hasn't.$ I've searched her apartment.$ The falcon is not there.$ Because she gave it to Jacobi in Hong Kong.$ Gave it to him?$ To bring back to America, while she and Thursby took another boat.$ What time does the Paloma dock?$ I phoned the harbor.$ She's expected in before midnight.$ - We better hurry.$ - Well, he still has got my money.$ Wilmer can take care of him.$ No.$ No.$ I know a better way.$ My technique is not so abrupt as Wilmer's.$ My apologies for the interruption, Mr. Spade.$ Had we finished our little deal, or hadn't we?$ - We certainly had.$ - I am delighted to hear you say that, sir.$ We shall drink to an affiliation which will prove, I am sure, a pleasure and a benefit to us both.$ Okay.$ Well, here's to clear understanding.$ Yes, sir.$ All successful business deals are floated on the wave of good fellowship.$ - Do you agree with me, Mr. Spade?$ - Perfectly.$ Yeah.$ I thought you would, Mr. Spade.$ Hey, what are you doing here this hour of the night?$ Well, you told me to stick around till you came back.$ - Sam!$ - Wait a minute.$ - He's dead, honey.$ - Oh, but, Sam,$ - don't you think we ought to get a doctor?$ - Well, a doctor won't do any good.$ Quick, lock that door.$ Sam, who is he?$ " John Jacobi.$ " Captain of the La Paloma.$ Arrived San Francisco from Hong Kong."$ Let's have a look at the bag.$ Ruth Wonderly.$ Unlatch that, honey.$ Sam, what is that?$ Honey, it's the black bird they're all after.$ I don't know why it's so valuable, but it's worth a fortune.$ Sam, whoever shot that captain will do the same to you.$ I'm afraid.$ Get rid of it.$ Oh, stop worrying, honey.$ I'll take care of it.$ - What are you gonna do with it?$ - Now, don't ask questions.$ - Check this.$ - Yes, sir.$ - Hello, Tom.$ - Writing love letters, Sam?$ - Yeah.$ - Don't go too far with that.$ It's one of the best ways of getting in trouble.$ Are you telling me?$ I'm looking for you all night to tell you something.$ From Dundy?$ No, the District Attorney this time.$ He wants to see you.$ What's he want to see me for?$ It's Iva Archer, Sam.$ She's been dishing plenty of dirt.$ Spade, who killed Miles Archer?$ I don't know.$ You certainly could make an excellent guess.$ My guesses might be excellent, but I'm not silly enough to make them in front of a District Attorney.$ I don't think I'm convinced yet that the police have the right theory.$ Well, I'm glad of that.$ They've narrowed the solution down to just two things.$ Number one,Archer was killed by a woman who wanted him out of the way.$ Number two, the wife's paramour committed the crime with the object of removing Archer as an obstacle to their illicit relations.$ And number three,$ Archer died of old age.$ You're not serious.$ Spade, you're concealing information that will enable us to solve this.$ And by withholding that information, you make yourself an accomplice to a murder.$ I thought this was gonna be an informal talk.$ I am a sworn officer of the law 24 hours a day, and neither formality or informality justifies you in withholding from me evidence of a crime.$ Unless, of course, you're afraid of incriminating yourself.$ I've got nothing to tell you or the police.$ Now, if you have anything more to say to me, why, have me pinched, and I'll come down here with my lawyer.$ I've been thinking of doing that.$ Well, when you make up your mind, let me know.$ And when I do, Spade, you'll know that we have information about you and Miles Archer's wife that will require a lot of explanation.$ Well, the only chance I see of saving myself would be to bring in the murderers all tied up in a nice little bouquet.$ I'll give you just 24 hours to do that.$ Thanks.$ I'll make a note of it on my cuff.$ And remember this, Spade, if you don't come through by this time tomorrow,I'll order you arrested for the murder of Miles Archer.$ You can always get me at my office or my home, Mr. Bryant.$ I aim to give service at all times, night and day.$ Goodbye, sweetheart.$ Sam!$ Sam, I didn't think you'd ever get here.$ I've been waiting hours for you.$ Where have you been?$ I've been looking all over for you.$ I think there's someone following me.$ Take me upstairs, quick.$ Okay.$ Sam.$ Oh, so we have company, huh?$ Well, sir, we're all here.$ Shall we sit down and be comfortable while we discuss the matter?$ What matter?$ We know, of course, that you have the falcon.$ Oh, have I?$ Well, when can you make the first payment?$ You know we were talking of more money than this.$ We were, sir, but we were just talking.$ This is actual coin.$ Permit me to remind you, Mr. Spade, you may have the falcon, but we most certainly have you.$ I'm not gonna let that worry me.$ Now listen to me carefully, every one of you.$ There's an angle to this deal you've all overlooked.$ - And what is that, sir?$ - We've got to have a fall guy.$ - A fall guy?$ - Certainly.$ We've got to feed the police a victim.$ Somebody they can stick for those three murders.$ You can't expect us to believe that you're afraid of the police and not able to handle them.$ I'm not afraid of the police, and I can handle them.$ But you've gotta toss them somebody to hang the works on.$ You can't be serious, sir.$ A fall guy, as you call it, would only lead them to the falcon.$ No, we leave well enough alone.$ Well, get this through your brain, Gutman.$ The police are not asleep, they're laying low and waiting.$ And I'm in this mess up to my neck, and they know it.$ You're not a man that worries about a little trouble, sir.$ You'll manage that.$ While you skip to New York or China or someplace, huh?$ Well, I'm in business here, remember that.$ This is my town and my racket, and I know what's best for us.$ Gutman, we're sunk, unless we hand over a fall guy.$ Well, none of us exactly qualifies for the part, sir.$ My dear sir, it's too ridiculous.$ Why, I feel toward Wilmer exactly as if he were my own son.$ Well, you can easily pick another son, but there's only one black bird.$ - Remember that.$ - Lf your scheme were practical, which it isn't, what would prevent Wilmer from telling the police about the falcon and all of us?$ Oh, we can have him shot for resisting arrest.$ My fondness for Wilmer renders it impossible.$ Well, I have another suggestion to make.$ Why don't you give them Cairo?$ Why not you or Miss Wonderly?$ I don't care.$ Anybody.$ All I insist on is a fall guy.$ You seem to forget that you are not in a position to insist on anything.$ I am in a swell position, and don't you forget it.$ Let's settle this.$ You've received your money, why can't we have the falcon now?$ I said I want 20,000 bucks, and besides, I couldn't get the bird before daylight.$ Daylight?$ Well, in that case, perhaps it will be best for us all if we don't get out of each other's sight until our business has been transacted.$ Wilmer, lock that door.$ See that nobody leaves or enters.$ You have the envelope?$ I have it.$ Honey, it's a long wait before daylight.$ You better go and fix some eggs, some sandwiches and some coffee.$ We must entertain our guests.$ Why, of course.$ You will all excuse me, won't you?$ Now just a moment, my dear.$ Better leave the envelope.$ You don't want to get any grease spots on it.$ Oh, how stupid of me.$ There are only nine bills here now, but when I gave them to you, there were 10.$ Wait a minute.$ Say, you had the money last, now one of the bills is missing.$ - Where is it?$ - I didn't take it, Sam.$ - Maybe you didn't, but I have to find out.$ - You won't take my word for it?$ No, I won't take your word for it.$ Take off your clothes.$ I will not.$ - Oh, yes, you will.$ - Well, I certainly won't.$ All right.$ I'll have them take them off for you.$ Sam.$ Very well.$ - You palmed it, Gutman.$ - Ridiculous.$ I said you palmed it.$ Now, if you don't admit it, I'm gonna frisk you.$ Yes, sir.$ Yes, I did.$ I was curious to know what you would do.$ That's a trick I'd expect from somebody the skunk's age.$ So you're trying to frame Miss Wonderly, huh?$ Frame her?$ You were going to let her be the fall guy.$ Well, I'm gonna decide right now who it's going to be.$ It's gonna be Wilmer.$ What do you think of the idea, Wilmer?$ Funny, hey?$ - I'll give him something to laugh at.$ - Now, now, Wilmer.$ You shouldn't attach so much importance to these things.$ The gentleman is only joking.$ Well, make him lay off me, or I'll fog him.$ - And nothing'll stop me.$ - Now, now, Wilmer.$ Now, now, sit down.Come on, sit down.$ I'll lay you two to one, they're selling you out, kid.$ Spade...$ Well, here's our fall guy.$ - But...$ But...$ - There's no but about it.$ You say yes right now, or I'll turn the black bird and the whole gang of you in.$ Well,you can have him, sir.$ What about you, Cairo?$ Are you with us or against us?$ - I'm with you.$ - That's swell.$ Now we're getting someplace.$ Berkeley 007.$ Poor Wilmer.$ - Hello?$ - Hello, honey.$ I'm sorry to get you out of bed.$ Oh, that's all right.What is it?$ Listen, dear, you know our general delivery box at the post office?$ There's an envelope in my handwriting.$ There's a baggage checker for that suitcase we got last night.$ I want you to bring it over to my apartment early this morning.$ - All right.$ - Atta girl.$ Goodbye, honey.$ - I'll take the envelope now.$ - With the greatest of pleasure, sir.$ - All right, Gutman.$ Sit down.$ - Thank you.$ Now, let's get the details fixed.$ Just why did Wilmer kill Thursby, and how did he kill Captain Jacobi?$ Thursby was a notorious killer, sir, and Miss Wonderly's protector.$ We tried to persuade him to join us, but we couldn't.$ So Wilmer followed him to his hotel and did what he did.$ If Wilmer killed both of them with the same gun then the bullets will match.$ Captain Jacobi's death was entirely Miss Wonderly's fault.$ Just how do you mean that?$ He would never have been killed if she hadn't entrusted the falcon to him in Hong Kong.$ Oh, I see.$ Then he was in on the deal with all of you?$ No, sir.$ He knew nothing about it.$ But after he came under the influence of Miss Wonderly's charm, he agreed to bring the falcon to America$ - while she came on a fast boat.$ - With Thursby?$ The falcon went from Thursby to Jacobi, and from Jacobi, at her instructions, to you.$ Then I was next in line after Captain Jacobi.$ Miss Wonderly's admirers have been many, sir, and she has used them all to her great advantage.$ Say, what's the matter with you?$ Just a fly.$ - Hello, Sam.$ - Hello, honey.$ - Here it is.$ - Thanks a lot.$ - Anything else?$ - No, I'll see you later at the office.$ - All right, goodbye.$ - Goodbye.$ Well, here's your black bird.$ Clear the table.$ It's the falcon, all right.$ But we make sure.$ Get a knife.$ This is a fake.$ This is not the real falcon.$ Well, that's the only one I know about.$ You've had your little joke, why don't you tell them where the real one is?$ Oh, no, Sam.$ I swear this is the one I got from Kemidov.$ That's it!$ It was the Russian.$ Kemidov.$ You have bungled the whole thing, you fathead!$ You let him know it was valuable, and he made a duplicate.$ And what fools he's made of us.$ Chasing each other around the world for a lump of lead.$ Yes.$ Yes, it's the Russian.$ There's no doubt of that.$ Well,I have to admit the fault is mine.$ Well, shall we stand here and call each other names, or shall we go back to Constantinople and Kemidov?$ - You're going to try for it again?$ - Certainly.Why not?$ I am with you.$ Wilmer, you'll go, of course.$ - Your little boyfriend checked out.$ - Oh.$ Oh, well.$ That's too bad.$ Yeah.$ Yeah, his services would have been invaluable.$ And I loved him like a son.$ I'll trouble you for that envelope, sir.$ Don't be silly, Gutman.$ It's your hard luck, not mine.$ Oh.$ My $ 10,000, please.$ Good day, sir.$ I deeply regret that you are left without a fall guy.$ I'll do all right.$ Union 2000.$ Right.$ - Hello?$ - Hello, Tom.$ - Sam Spade.$ - Hello, Sam.$ Listen, move up fast on three crooks leaving town.$ Gutman, Palace Hotel, Room 900.$ And Cairo.$ Yes, you met the guy over here.$ And a kid named Wilmer Cook.$ That's right.$ Cook shot Thursby and Jacobi.$ I've got the gun the kid used.$ I've got it right here in my place.$ - Yeah.$ And you better step on it.$ - Thanks for the tip.$ Listen, honey, let me get this straight with you.$ What, darling?$ You and Cairo double-crossed Gutman, and then you ditched Cairo in favor of Thursby.Is that right?$ Something like that, yes.$ Just why did you give the black bird to Jacobi?$ I was afraid that Thursby couldn't be trusted.$ - That Gutman might buy him over.$ - That's a lie.$ You had him hooked, and you knew it.$ What was your scheme for disposing of Thursby?$ I thought if he saw that Archer was following him, it might frighten him into leaving town.$ I didn't think he'd really shoot Archer.$ Well, if you thought that you were right, Thursby never killed Archer.$ Oh, I know Archer was dumb, but not dumb enough to let Thursby catch him up a blind alley with his gun stuck away in his hip pocket and his overcoat buttoned.$ But he'd have gone up that alley with you, honey.$ Sam, don't talk to me like that.$ And if you had asked him to go up that alley with you, and he knew no one else were there, he would've gone.$ And then you could have stood with your body close up against his, and he would have grinned from ear to ear, and you could've shot a hole right through him.$ How did you know he grinned?$ I know Archer, and I want to know why you killed him.$ Well, you did kill him, didn't you?$ I didn't mean to at first.$ I meant what I said when I told you that I just wanted Thursby frightened.$ - But when I found out I couldn't, I...$ - Oh, stop lying.$ I'll tell you why you shot him.$ You figured that Thursby would be nailed for the killing, and then you could get the black bird for yourself.$ But when you found out Thursby was shot, you needed a protector, and so you came back to me, right?$ I would have come back to you sooner or later.$ You know, from the first time I saw you, I knew that sometime I'd come back to you.$ You angel.$ Well, with a lucky break you ought to be out of San Quentin in 20 years, and then you can come back to me.$ I hope they don't hang you, honey.$ You know, it'd be a shame to stretch that pretty little neck of yours.$ Sam, don't say such things.$ Not even in fun.$ You can't!$ Not after what we've been to each other.$ Don't be silly, sister.$ You're gonna take the fall.$ You mean you're really gonna send me over?$ I don't mean anything else but.$ Then you've been pretending.$ You don't care.$ - You don't love me.$ - Oh, I think I do.$ But what of it?$ I'm not Thursby or Jacobi, and I won't play the sap for you.$ You know down in your heart that in spite of everything I've done$ - I love you.$ - Maybe.$ You haven't been on the level with me for a half-hour at a stretch.$ Why, you double-crossed every man$ - that was fool enough to fall for you.$ - Not you, Sam.$ I couldn't.$ I'm mad about you.$ Oh, it...It's easy enough to be nuts about you, too.$ What of it?$ That'll all pass.$ Oh, I'll have some rotten nights.$ They won't mean anything.$ I'll get over you in time.$ Oh, hello, boys.$ - Come on in.$ - Hello.$ Hello, Spade.$ There you are, Tom.$ Exhibit A.$ These are the guns the kid used to kill Thursby and Jacobi.$ Yeah, well, he used another one since.$ The hotel says Gutman is dead.$ Shot to death by Wilmer Cook.$ - The kid got him, eh?$ - Yeah, him and Cairo.$ We grabbed the kid just as he was leaving the hotel.$ - Well, I guess that settles everything.$ - Not quite.$ There's another murder to clear up before noon.$ - What's on your mind?$ - Archer.$ - Got it all figured out how I did it?$ - I've done a lot of figuring.$ All right.$ Gentlemen, you know Miss Wonderly.$ - Yeah.$ - Yeah, how do?$ She killed Archer with Thursby's gun.$ She's an accomplice of Cairo and the kid.$ Have you got enough on her to make a pinch?$ Don't worry, Dundy.$ I've got enough evidence to cinch everything that I say.$ - Yeah?$ - Yeah.$ All right.$ Come on, sister, let's be going.$ What a pity the detective agencies haven't more men with your strength of character, Mr. Spade.$ Don't worry about me, Miss Wonderly.$ There's nothing funny about this.$ - When will we see you?$ - I'll be down later.$ - She's in number 10, sir.$ - Thanks.$ Say, kid.Got a cigarette?$ Thanks.$ - Hello.$ - Hello.$ Hi, boy.$ Cigarette, honey?$ How's the food?$ Rotten?$ You just couldn't keep away from me, could you?$ Well, not when I've got good news for you.$ Good news?$ They just made me Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's office.$ Well, they couldn't find a better man for the job.$ Thanks, baby.$ I thought you'd like to know.$ You helped me get it.$ I assure you it was a labor of love.$ Love?$ Just that, Sam.$ Well, if there's any little thing you need, why, let me know.$ Goodbye.$ - Sarah.$ - Yes, Sam.$ I want you to be very nice to that girl in number 10.$ Give her anything she wants.$ Good food.$ Cigarettes and candy.$ - You know what I mean.$ - Very well, Sam.$ Just as you say.$ But who will I charge it to?$ Send the bill to the District Attorney's office.$ I'll okay it.$ But would that be all right?$ Yes, sir.$ English$

Uh, Mr. Taylor, please.Not theJimmie Powers I used to know.$ Why, he was the most promising newspaperman in the country.$ Oh, what of it?$ Michael Trevor calling.$ Mr. Taylor said you were to come right up.$ Room 309, sir.$ Thank you.$ How are you, Mr. Taylor?$ Come on in.$ Sit down.$ Thank you.$ Well, it's nice to see you again.$ I tried to call you up myself, but I didn't know where to get hold of you.$ I guess I was a little tight that day I met you at the Ritz.$ Oh.I kind of forgot to get your phone number.$ Well, I got yours.$ So, here we are.$ Yep.$ Here we are.Have a drink?$ Oh, thank you, no.$ - I had a purpose in phoning you this morning, Mr. Taylor.$ Aside from my desire to see you again, of course.$ Glad you did.$ I'll try to be as brief as possible.$ I don't know if you know very much about me.$ Oh, sure, I do.$ You're just being modest.$ Oh, thank you.$ I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Trevor.$ Yeah?$ They tell me you're over here writing a great novel.$ Ah.I wish I could be as sure of that as they are.$ Well, all I know is that some four years ago I quit being a newspaperman in America.$ Now I'm over here to see if I can really write.$ You've been in Paris four years?$ Mmm.I wish I could stay over here four years.$ Hmm.I've only been here a week.$ For the most part, we have a very nice crowd of Americans living here in Paris permanently.$ Paris is certainly a liberal education.$ Isn't it?$ I thought I'd seen a lot, but let me tell you.These Frenchmen- -$ Uh, French.$ And how!$ Unfortunately, there are a few Americans living in this town who are not exactly all they might be.$ Frankly, there's only a handful, but they're what I've come to see you about.$ There was a little redhead at the Folies-Bergere the other night.$ And let me tell you- -Ah, yes.$ I know.I know.$ Now, uh, these fellows I'm talking about, Mr. Taylor, live by their wits- - and by other people's lack of them.$ I ran into one of them last night.$ He helps get out a weekly paper here, printed in English.$ No good here.$ Me, I didn't come to Paris to read.$ Uh, this paper isn't circulated much in Paris.$ It's meant chiefly for American consumption.$ This fellow was drunk, and he talked too much.$ Much too much.$ Among other things, he showed me a copy of an item they're going to run in their next week's issue.$ I... put it in my pocket when he wasn't looking.$ Well, fine.$ Just leave it here, and I'll read it.$ Well, I think you had better read it right away.$ It's, uh-- It's about you.About me?$ Well, what's it say?$ Well- -$ It says,$ '" Tis a pity that some of our compatriots are so naive and lacking in worldly knowledge.$ " Surely Mr. Harold Taylor, the soft coal baron of Stratford, Pennsylvania," could not have been aware of the identity of the very blonde and very beautiful young woman... with whom he seemed to be on such intimate terms at Zelli's the other morning at 4: 00."$ " With whom he seemed to be on such intimate terms at Zelli's the other morning at 4: 00.$ " Those in the know were forced to smile broadly..." as this strangely assorted couple left the restaurant..." arm in arm.$ Watch your step, Harry boy."$ We, uh, got so well acquainted that day at the Ritz, Mr. Taylor, that I thought I'd take the liberty of bringing this item to you.$ You could do those of us living here a great service.$ We know who gets out this sheet.$ And what we would like you to do... is to take this item to the police and get the whole gang arrested.Arrested?$ Exactly.$ You're a man of the world, and you know that the kind of fellow back of a thing like that... can't last 1 0 minutes if the police are put on his trail.$ Police?$ You could put him where he belongs:$ behind the bars.$ Say.Just a minute.$ If I-- If I go to the police, it'll get in the papers, won't it?$ Probably.$ Well, that's something I don't want any part of.$ Ah, but, Mr. Taylor- - I can't afford to have this item get back to America.$ And I-- I can't afford to let it be known that I had it stopped.$ Well, I'm sorry.$ It's always the same old thing.$ Every time we get something on this fellow that could send him to jail, the victim is unwilling to prosecute.$ I'd like to help you out, but- - but I can't.$ I suppose not.$ Well, I'm sorry I wasted your time, Mr. Taylor.$ I'll say good day.$ Oh.Oh, just a minute.Uh, wait a minute.$ How would I go about getting this fella not to print this little item?$ Well, I don't know.$ I don't suppose it would be very difficult.$ You think not?$ It would be worth something to me not to have it appear.$ Say, I wonder if you'd do me a favor?$ Most certainly.If I can.$ How about, uh, you seeing this fellow for me?$ My seeing him?Yes.$ He'd probably listen to you, where he wouldn't to me.$ Chances are he'd try to hold me up for more.$ Of course, uh, I'd be prepared to pay something for it.$ Pay him, of course.Oh.Oh.$ I didn't mean, uh- -$ Say, you'd be doing me an awful service if you'd help me out on this.$ Well, I'll certainly be glad to do anything I can.Ah.$ Suppose a couple of thousand?Uh- -$ Wait a minute.Comment?$ Don't pull up your flag.$ Why do I always have to get chauffeurs who don't speak English?$ Now maybe he'll get the idea I want him to wait.$ Don't you want to come in a minute, Frank?$ Not a chance.$ If I'm going to get back here and take you to dinner by 7: 00 and then catch that train for London,I've got to get home and pack and send a couple of wires.$ There it goes again.$ There what goes again?$ Business.$ Oh, Mary.$ I know you have to go, Frank, but it's that kind of thing that keeps me from making up my mind.$ I don't want to- - to get engaged to a man who thinks of nothing but business all the time.$ Oh, Mary, if you'd only say you'll marry me, I'd cut out business- - if you wanted me to.$ That's just it.$ I don't want you to stop doing the things you want to do, just on account of me.$ What do you want me to do?$ I wish I knew.$ I was only fooling, Frank.$ I'm not really mad.$ I wish you'd blow a whistle from now on when you're fooling.$ I never can tell.$ I never want you to be able to tell.$ We seem to be causing a traffic jam.$ They can work up a tra- - traffic jam in this town with just one car.$ 7: 00.$ Don't forget.$ I won't.$ And whatever the French is for" Try and get me there alive." I can't tell you how much obliged I am to you, Mr. Trevor.$ I'll see that he gets this.$ I think I can guarantee you this is the last you'll hear of the matter.$ From what they say of this fellow, he seems to be living from hand to mouth, so I'm sure your donation will be more than enough to shut him up.$ That's great.$ Of course, I would have rather had you bring charges against him.$ Oh, no, no.No, no.That's out of the question.$ Well, I suppose so.$ I wish you'd have dinner with me some night before I go.$ Oh, thank you.$ I don't get out very much, but if I do get the chance- -$ Uh- - Oh.Excuse me.$ That's all right, Mary.$ Come right in.$ This is a friend of mine.$ A real good friend of mind.Mr. Trevor.$ Mr. Trevor, this is my niece Mary.Mary Kendall.$ How do you do, Mr. Trevor?$

tomorrow.$ I wish you could meet Frank.$ He's a fine boy.$ He and Mary are going- -$ Uncle Harry has the soul of a matchmaker, Mr. Trevor.$ Just because Frank and I grew up together and are fond of each other- -$ Well, in my time, you didn't need much more than to grow up together and be fond of each other.$ Wait till you meet him, Mr. Trevor.$ He's got the stuff, that kid.$ He's going to be one of the richest men in the state before he's through.$ I'm sure Mr. Trevor isn't interested- -You're right.I-$ - I guess I do talk a little too much.$ I'm afraid I'll have to be running along now.$ I wish you'd wait and have a drink.$ Oh, thank you.$ Some other time perhaps.$ Say, wait.Uh- -$ I'll bet you know all the places in Paris.$ Where's a good place to have dinner?$ Oh, Uncle Harry.$ Oh, it's a pleasure, Miss Kendall.$ Well, let's see.There's Ciro's of course, but all Americans go there.$ Yes.$ We did.$ Uh, have you tried, uh, the Paradis d'Azur?$ Paradis d'Azur?$ " Blue Heaven"?Yes.$ Oh.$ Good orchestra?$ Excellent.$ We'll try it tonight.$ Thank you.$ Good-bye, Miss Kendall.$ Good-bye, Mr. Trevor.$ Good-bye, Mr. Taylor.$ Good-bye.$ And thanks a thousand.$ Uh, two thousand.$ That's one swell guy, that fellow.$ I'll say so.$ He did me a big favor.$ I'd certainly like to do something for him sometime.$ Some business deal?$ Well, yes and no.$ He's a writer living in Paris.$ I'd like to live in Paris.$ Me too.$ Of course, a fellow would have to watch his step, but...I'll bet it'd be a lot of fun once you got to know the place.$ How do you like my new hat?$ Oh, it's a humdinger.$ Why don't you come along to dinner with me and Frank tonight?$ No, no.I have a business meeting.$ I hope this business meeting breaks up before daylight.$ Do you know what time the elevator man told me you got in last night?$ There's a fortune waiting for any elevator man who can't tell time.$ Bonsoir, Marie.$ Bonsoir, Monsieur Trevor.$ How is every little thing, big boy?$ Hotsy-totsy?$ You're getting on, Marie.$ Thank you.$ Thank you.$ Good evening, Louis.$ Good evening, Monsieur Trevor.$ Well?$ Only table four and 1 7, Monsieur Trevor.$ The lady at table four is a Mrs.Jowitt, from St. Louis.$ Well, here's to you.$ Why, that's the Mrs.Jowitt who got here last month, isn't it?$ She's just a babe in the woods- - especially for Spade Henderson.$ The waiter reports that Mrs.Jowitt... picked up Spade at Henry's Bar an hour ago.$ Well, I may make this Mrs.Jowitt the object of my good deed today.$ I am at peace with the world, Louis.$ Fortune has been kind to me.$ Besides, it might be just as well for my friend Henderson... to learn to follow my rule of keeping women off his list of customers.$ Excellent rule, Mr. Trevor.$ And, uh, number 1 7?$ A very, very wealthy Mr. Bradkins from Chicago.$ The prettiest hand I ever saw.$ The lady with him is not his wife.$ Not his wife?$ Louis, I'm afraid you're losing your illusions.$ The pleasantest of occupations, Monsieur Trevor.Mmm.$ I wonder.$ This note may be of interest to Spade.$ He needn't know who sent it.$ Yes, Mr. Trevor.$ Thank you, Louis.$ How do you do?$ Good evening.$ No supper, Louis.$ Just a small bottle of Perrier.$ Yes, Monsieur Trevor.$ A friend of Uncle Harry's.$ I met him this afternoon.$ Another old friend whom your uncle never saw before today.$ Oh, you never can tell.$ Uncle says he's a very clever novelist.$ What's his name?$ Trevor.$ Pardon me.$ Certainly.$ Who gave you this note?$ It was left at the door, monsieur, a moment ago.$ I see.$ Bad news?$ - Say, Mrs.Jowitt, I wonder if you'd excuse me?$ Why?What's the matter?$ Uh, an important call.$ I've gotta see a fella right away.$ Oh, here.Wait a minute.$ I thought we were going to go places and do things.$ Sorry.$ Some other time maybe.$ I've gotta run.$ So long.$ Well, if this is Paris, something tells me I'm not going to like it.$ Oh, Frank, I wish you weren't going.$ I'll only be gone 1 0 days- - or less.$ Ten days is pretty long.$ I wouldn't be going if I didn't have to see this fellow.$ I wish I could have gotten a stateroom.$ I get seasick so easy, and the thought of having to sit up for three hours... while I'm being tossed around on that channel doesn't make me any too happy.$ Sometimes I think I'd have been better off if I'd spent my summer in Pittsburgh.$ There must be some way of getting a stateroom.$ The porter at the hotel did everything he could.$ He said there wasn't a chance.$ Phone the company.$ Maybe somebody turned back a reservation.$ That's a great idea.$ No.$ I've changed my mind.$ It's a terrible idea.$ I'd rather swim the Channel than tackle one of these French phones.$ But you've got to get a stateroom.$ Not if I have to phone, I don't.$ Oh, you big baby.$ If you won't do something, I will.$ I know who can do it.$ You've got a lot of crust, if you ask me, Mary.$ Mr. Trevor, may I present Mr. Reynolds?$ How do you do, Mr. Reynolds?$ Won't you sit down, Mr. Trevor?$ Oh, thank you.$ I wonder if you'd do us a favor?$ Of course.$ Gladly.Frank has to go to London tonight.$ He was going to fly this afternoon, but they called off the service on account of fog.$ Now he has a ticket on the boat, but no stateroom.They were all sold out.$ You would like me to help you to get a stateroom.Is that it?$ You get the general idea.$ Ah, yes.$ Max.$ Oui, monsieur.Uh, what time does your train leave, Mr. Reynolds?$ 2: 00.$ Is that all?$ Uh, that's all.$ I asked him to wire the purser.He's a friend of mine.$ There'll be a stateroom waiting for you in my name.$ How about a little wine, Mr. Trevor?$ Oh.I think not.$ Thank you.$ We're awfully obliged to you.$ Oh, not at all.$ How is Paris treating you?$ Pretty well.$ I'm afraid we don't know the places to go to.$ I think this place is lovely, but I would like to see some French people.$ This has been a favorite hangout of Americans for years.$ The prices are higher here than anywhere else.$ Uncle Harry says you know Paris so well, Mr. Trevor.Where should we go from here?$ Well, if you've time, uh, there's a little place I make a habit of dropping into at night... just before going to bed when I'm really hungry.$ If you like, uh, why not come there with me?$ It's very French.$ Say, that's an idea.$ But surely we've taken all the advantage of you- - Oh, not at all.$ If you're sure we wouldn't be intruding.I'd like to get away from this tourist stuff for awhile.$ Well, uh, will you be my guests?$ Not to give you a short answer, Mr. Trevor, yes.$ Good.$ Ready, Frank?$ I suppose so.$ I never know whether I'm getting change or owe the place money.$ Merci, monsieur.If you say this is the real stuff, I suppose it is.$ But I had Paris figured out all different.$ Well, I suppose Paris means something different for everyone.$ For you, I imagine it means clothes.$ To Mr. Reynolds, uh, an interlude.$ Pause between business deals.$ To your uncle, I daresay it means, uh, change.$ And to you?$ I don't know.$ There was a time when it meant everything:$ gaiety, glamour, adventure.$ Now- - And now?$ Now it's just a place to live... and eat onion soup at 1: 00 in the morning.$ In America at this hour I suppose it would mean chop suey.$ Give me chop suey every time.$ I don't know but what I agree with you.$ You know, years ago I used to be a- - a reporter.$ After we put the paper to bed at night, we used to stop in at a little place on the corner for chop suey and, uh- -$ Foo yong.Foo yong.$ I hadn't thought of that for years.$ I suppose living in Paris makes up for not having a bowl of chop suey.$ I suppose so.$ It's not the chop suey you miss.$ It's what it stands for.$ Home.$ America.$ Friends.$ Fellows I used to know.$ Plain things without sauces.$ Hello, Mr. Trevor.$ Oh, hello, Fred.$ Off your beaten path a bit tonight, aren't you?$ Yes.$ I guess I am.$ You know, these folks want to see all the sights marked on the picture postcards.$ I'm beginning to think they've been getting the wrong kind of postcards.$ The best American guide in Paris, that fellow.$ He doesn't seem to be any better than you are.$ That man back there was Michael Trevor.$ Very prominent American writer.Very prominent.$ What's he written?$ Books.$ Novels I guess you'd call' em.$ But I don't know.$ When you get right down to it, what are they?$ Nothing but books.$ It's five past 1: 00.$ I've got to be going.$ It's been very nice of you to show us around like this, Mr. Trevor.$ My pleasure.I'll only be gone 1 0 days.$ I'd be tickled to death if you'd be my guest some night when I get back.$ Thank you.$ You'd better hurry back.$ Uncle Harry will go out of his mind if has to spend all his time with me.$ Pretty tough.His first week in Paris, and having to take you around wherever he goes.$ I can't imagine his ever regarding you as a burden.$ Only in Paris, I hope.Oh.$ If I can, uh, relieve him of any part of it- -$ If you could take Mary around a bit, that would be great.$ Oh.That's fine.$ Now all we need is Mar- - uh, Miss Kendall's consent.$ Mary consents with very unmaidenly rapidity.$ Come on.$ Let's go now.$ It's late.$ Thank you.$ I'd like to call you tomorrow, if I may.There's a special cup race at Longchamps.$ Oh, I'd love to go!Good.$ Suppose I call for you tomorrow at, uh, 1: 00?$ Oh, that'll be fine.$ Well, I think I'll walk home.$ I wouldn't dare walk five steps from this door.$ I'd get lost.$ There'll be a taxi along, uh, almost any minute, I'm sure.$ Thanks a lot for showing us around.$ Not at all.$ Until tomorrow then?Good night.$ Good night.$ Good night.$ I like that guy.$ He's very nice.$ He's--Well, I mean, he's, uh- -$ He's very charming and sophisticated.$ It's a great break for you to get a man like that, that knows all about Paris to ask you to go out with him.$ To ask me to go out with him?$ Don't be silly.$ We did everything but lasso him.$ Taxi!$ Come on, Mary.$ If I'd say" Hotel de Régent," where do you think we'd wind up?$ Let's find out.$ Hotel de Régent. 2: 00.$ Think of the places I could have gone, the things I could have done.$ He'll probably be along any day now.$ No need getting up on your ear about it.$ Nothing's happened to him.$ I told you.$ I saw him myself at Papa Jules's less than an hour ago.$ Well, I'm not gonna wait around half the night for him.$ You've had a lot of practice doing it.$ Maybe.$ But I quit worrying about him personally six months ago.$ Kind of mutual, wasn't it?$ Mutual or not, strictly business.$ That's little Irenie from now on.$ You know, I don't mind your kidding me, but I kind of hate to see you kid somebody else.$ Somebody else?$ Yourself.$ Now, wouldn't you know it?$ It's all your life is worth to even turn around in this room.$ Say, that guy's got books where I wouldn't put... hairpins.$ What does he do with them all?$ Read them?$ Well, what do you suppose he does?$ Practice juggling?$ Say, that cuckoo would rather read than eat.$ The Money Systems of the Middle Ages.$ There's a hot subject for you.$ As far as I'm concerned, there's just one little book we need.$ That's all.$ Just one.$ Good old Dun Bradstreet:$ who's who, and how much has he got?$ When you're through with a guy, it's how much did he have, isn't it?$ I manage to get along pretty well.$ If you only weren't so shy and uncommunicative, Irene.$ Fancy seeing you here!$ You must have forgotten.$ You were supposed to meet us here two hours ago.$ Oh, so that was it.$ Somehow I, uh, couldn't recall what it was I had forgotten.$ I hope your fit of aphasia didn't include Harry Taylor.$ My dear Irene, armed with nothing but my trusty fountain pen and galley proofs,I stalked Mr. Taylor to his lair and bagged this.$ Too bad you can't have checks stuffed and hung above the fireplace.$ Did he make any fuss?$ Fuss?$ He almost kissed me.$ As a matter of fact, I'm a friend of the family now.$ Guess where I've been.$ At the Ritz bar.$ No.$ Well, then I can't guess.$ Dining with Taylor's niece and her young man.$ Oh, that's the people you were with at Papa Jules's.$ You mean you met the girl?His niece?$ Exactly.$ Well, we are lucky.$ Say, that couple of pennies that Taylor gave you is nothing at all compared to what we can get.$ Say, if he came across that easy to keep his own name out of the papers, what do you suppose he'd be willing to part with for his dear little niece?$ You know, when I was getting the dope on them, I had a feeling we were blowing into the wrong end of the horn.$ Now I know it.$ Here's a chance to make a real killing.$ You just give that dame the works and see how quick her uncle will come across.$ I tell you.It's money from home.$ That's what it is.$ Taking money from women isn't in my line.$ It never has been, and you know it.$ Oh, it's not as if you'd really hurt anybody.$ Gee.The girl doesn't have to know anything about it.$ You just put her in a spot where it'll look bad for her if she gets found out, and... her uncle will take care of the rest.$ Yes.I know the mechanics of the business.$ Well, maybe you don't know this:$ I've got to have some money, and I've got to have it quick.$ You're a fine, great big protector of womanhood.$ Only little Irenie doesn't matter.$ That isn't true.$ I'm not the type to put on a sob act, Michael.$ But if I tell you I've got to have it, that there's no other chance of keeping them from sending my brother to the jug back home, you'll believe me.$ I've never lied to you yet, Michael.$ This is the first time I've ever asked you to break that funny little rule of yours.$ Oh, it's been all over between us for a long time, I know, but what do you say?$ For me?$ For old time's sake.$ I need the dough like I never needed it before.$ Irene, you know I'd do anything I could for you- -$ We could all use the dough.$ That's the one argument I can never get around.$ " We could all use the dough."$ Okay.$ But first, last and only.$ Great!$ Anything you want me to do?$ No.$ I can handle this alone.$ Say, what's been getting into you lately?$ I don't know.$ I wish I did.$ Well, I'll tell you, if you want to know.$ You've been getting ideas.$ You've been doing everything but wearing a plume in your hat.$ The first thing I know, you'll be helping old ladies across the street.$ I used to help a Mrs. Allison across the street on account of her age.$ She was old, you see.$ You'd better snap out of it.$ You've been playing Robin Hood so long, you're beginning to believe in it yourself.$ Well, if that's all that's on your mind- - Yes.$ That's all.$ If I think of anything else, I'll send word by special messenger.$ Come on, Fred.$ Maybe we can find someplace where there aren't so many books.$ Maybe there'll be a few glasses in sight.$ I'm going home.$ You're going to buy Irenie a little nightcap before you do.$ I know better than to argue with you.$ I wish I could say as much for everybody in this room.$ So long, Mr. Trevor.$ See you later.$ French or not French, they look just like any other horses to me.Oh.$ You mean to say that you, uh, don't find even a trace of that je ne sais quoi for which France is so famous?$ Not a jenny.$ Anyway, I didn't come to Paris to look at horses.$ There's plenty of horses back home if I want to look at' em.$ But these are champions, Uncle Harry.$ Well, I've seen champions before.$ They're no treat to me.$ Say, how about going back to the bar and having another one of those funny little green drinks?$ Ah, yes.If you wish.$ If I had my wish about this party, we'd never have left the bar in the first place.$ The idea of spending a lovely afternoon like this looking at horses.$ But it keeps you out in the open air, Uncle Harry.$ Well, I had all the open air I wanted back home.$ Hello, Mr. Trevor.$ Hello.How are you?$ Fine.And you?$ Fred, you don't mean to tell me you're showing Miss Harper the town?$ Well, not exactly.$ There was a trainer down here in the paddock she didn't know.$ So I said I'd introduce her to him.Ah.I see.$ Oh, allow me.$ Uh, Miss Kendall, uh, Miss Harper.$ How do you do?$ Uh, Mr. Taylor, Miss Harper.$ Miss Harper has been one of the shining ornaments of our little colony here in Paris for several years.$ Oh, excuse me, Fred.$ Fred is the best American guide in Paris.$ You're just the fellow I want to see.$ Let me tell you something, mister.$ There's a fortune waiting for any guide who don't know anything about monuments, painting, historical edifices or- -$ A pen picture of Fred if ever I heard one.$ You've been doing pretty well dodging monuments and paintings, Uncle Harry, without a guide.$ Well, as I remember the old U.S.A., there's plenty of monuments right there.$ You're terrible, Uncle Harry.$ Not terrible.Just honest.$ Most of the time it's the same thing.$ Well, to be perfectly honest, would you think it terrible if I were to suggest a little drink?$ My error.$ I'll join you folks later.$ Uh, don't send out an alarm for me until I've been lost for at least 1 0 days.$ Well, so long, Mr. Trevor.$ I got some customers I gotta take to the Louvre.$ I should think you would know those pictures pretty well by now.$ Oh, I don't look at' em, Mr. Trevor.$ I just explain' em.Uh- -$ I didn't dare suggest it while your uncle was here, but, uh, what about seeing something of the race?$ What an old-fashioned idea.$ Let's try it.$ Let's.$ Thank you.$ See if they're set right.$ Yes.$ Oh, yes.$ Watch that number 1 1.$ Beautiful thing, isn't it?$ Oh, I hope he wins.$ Who won what?$ The man with the black and gold cap.$ Did you bet anything on him?$ No.$ Then what are you getting so excited about?$ There's thousands of races won every day someplace.$ I don't figure it's sensible to get excited about horses unless you win something.$ Why don't you give me something so I can win?$ Well, what did you do with that money I gave you yesterday?$ Putting your heart in your work, aren't you?$ Now I guess we can go back to the bar and get one of those funny-colored drinks.$ Oh, Mary can stay here with Mr. Trevor for the next race if she wants to.$ The sun hurts my eyes.$ I'm sure Mr. Trevor would rather remain here, wouldn't he?$ If I must answer yes or no, yes.$ We'll be back in a couple of minutes.$ Oh, Mr. Trevor, I'm afraid I'll have to renege on that opera tonight.$ But that Russian's going to conduct.$ Oh, I didn't mean I didn't want you to go.$ No, I really think you ought to go.$ It's just that Miss Harper here was telling me... about a new place in Montmartre that's opening up and I thought- -$ If Miss Harper knows of a new place in Montmartre that's opening up,I'm sure it's the kind of place that you would like.$ If Miss Kendall wouldn't mind going to the opera with me alone,$ I should be delighted to- - What do you say, Mary?$ I don't want to go to the opera if you don't want to.$ Well, I wouldn't like to have it generally known, but the opera I want to go to doesn't exist.$ Then it's settled.$ Come on, Miss Harper.$ I have a feeling we can get that fella to make some of that orange stuff... with some of that iced green stuff, and turn out something really beautiful.$ Good-bye, Mr. Trevor.$ Good-bye.$ Good-bye, Miss Kendall.$ Good-bye.$ I suppose I ought to feel angry with Uncle Harry, but somehow I don't.$ Angry?Why?$ For forcing us to go to the opera alone?$ That isn't what I meant.$ I mean angry for seeing so little of what Paris really can be.$ I adore it so, don't you?$ I'm not so sure but what he's seeing more of Paris than people who've lived here all their lives.$ Besides, I'm rather indebted to him for- -$ For what?$ For the opera.$ I should think you'd never want to finish writing your novel if it meant you had to leave Paris.$ I've had a guilty feeling these last few days that I've made you neglect your work.$ Ah, on the contrary.$ As a matter of fact, I've been thinking of changing my story entirely, throwing away everything I've written so far.$ Why?$ Well, I was writing the life of a man whom I thought I knew pretty well.$ It was all very definite in my mind.$ I didn't know exactly what the end was to be, but... it wasn't very hard to guess.$ But now it's all different.$ I may keep the same man for my hero, but...I think I'll change the entire course of his life.$ It all depends.$ You see, it's not entirely up to me.$ But if you're writing it- -$ In everything we do, whether we know it or not, there's always a collaborator.$ In this case, my hero has... fallen in love with a girl he's just met.$ Funny, I'd have bet a million dollars... that he wasn't the type to fall in love at first sight.$ But he has.$ I see.$ It's quite a problem.$ Why?$ Don't you see?$ He doesn't know whether she cares anything for him.$ I'm-- I'm not a novelist, but I know how to solve that.$ He ought to ask her.$ Perhaps.$ But suppose- - Suppose what?$ Suppose he's not the man she thinks he is, that he seems to be in the opening chapters.$ I may have to end it as I first planned it.$ If she's the girl you think you've written about, you won't.$ Don't you want to go back to your hotel?$ Do you?$ No.$ Neither do I.$ But I suppose we'd better.$ I suppose we'd better.$ Well, at last.$ Say, where have you been all this time?$ I've been taking a walk.$ Alone?$ Not exactly.$ Seems to me you've been doing a lot of walking these last four or five nights.$ It, uh, might be a good idea if you were to take these walks on some other nights... than when we have to get out this beautiful little weekly of yours.$ There may not be many more nights when we have to get out this beautiful little weekly of mine.$ I want to talk to you.$ That's never very difficult.$ Here, Fred.$ Now, be sure you get these corrections right.$ Let's print the corrections first next time.$ What are you driving at?$ Meaning?$ I wasn't born yesterday.$ You have a gift for unnecessary remarks.$ Never mind my gift.$ All right.$ We'll never mind all your gifts.$ To spare you the trouble of asking a lot of questions,I'll try to tell it to you as compactly as I can.$ I'm through.$ Through with what?$ Through with all this.$ With that printing press, with everything that's ever been printed on it, with- - with the whole works.$ You've fallen for that kid.$ I thought you had that afternoon at the races... when I saw you looking at her in that funny way.$ But I wasn't sure.$ Now I know.$ I suppose you think that you're in love.$ I believe I am in love.$ And I suppose she's in love with you?$ I think she is.$ Well, then think again.$ There's a fair chance that she's fallen for you, but she's not in love with you.$ You're different from anything she's ever met before.$ But she's not in love with you.$ There's not a chance in the world for a girl like that to be in love with you.$ I suppose you neglected to tell her who you really are and what you really do.$ That's over.$ Is it?$ Suppose I were to tell her a few things.$ You won't have to.$ I decided to let her know exactly what I am.$ When I think of you telling that girl the story of your life, the things you've done, the way you earn your living,I'll believe anything.$ Well, if it's all the same to you, I've got work to do.$ Somebody's gotta get those papers out.$ And if you're not gonna do your share, I guess I'll have to.$ Giving me the silence cure, huh?$ See if I care.$ Aw, you'll get this silly kid out of your system.Everything will be all right.$ Uh, Miss Mary Kendall, please.$ No, Mary Kendall.$ Right.$ Hello.$ Oh, hello.$ This is Michael.$ I'm so glad you told me.$ I might never have known.$ Mary, I'd like to see you.$ That makes it easier.$ I would like to see you.$ Right away.$ Right away.$ I'll come to the hotel and pick you up if you want, but...I'd prefer to meet you somewhere else.$ Somewhere else it is, milord.$ Well, can you be at that statue in the Bois in an hour?$ Uh, the statue of Cupid?$ Cupid.In an hour?$ You sound like a railroad schedule, but I'll be there.$ Good.$ Bye.$ Bye-bye.$ Before I ask you to listen to me, I must warn you... that I'm going to do a lot of talking about myself.$ I could think of nothing I could like better.$ No, you're wrong.$ Am I?$ You don't know anything about me- -$ I know everything about you.$ I knew everything about you the moment I saw you.$ Do you know what I do for a living?$ Of course.$ You used to be a newspaperman, and now you're over here writing for yourself.$ I used to be a newspaperman.$ Until I made a fool of myself.$ And then I came over here because... there was nothing further open to me among decent people, among my own people.$ Did your uncle say anything about how we met?$ Well, it doesn't matter.$ I've met a lot of people that way.$ I live by my wits.$ By finding out things that people don't want to have known about themselves... and by getting paid to keep quiet.$ I don't believe it.$ There was a time when I wouldn't have believed it myself.$ But that was back home, before- -$ Well, the details don't matter.$ I was a sap.$ And they made me pay for it.$ So I made up my mind to make other people pay my way from then on.$ That's all.$ Why have you told me this?$ Because I felt you ought to know.$ Why did you feel I ought to know?$ Because- -$ My telling you has served its purpose.$ You know now what kind of man I am.$ I know now what kind of man you were.$ What you're talking about used to be, didn't it?$ It's part of a past... to which I'll never return.$ Then what difference does it make?$ You know so much more than I do.$ You've seen so much more of the world than I have.$ And you make such a bad job of trying to fool me, Michael.$ I wasn't trying to fool you, Mary.$ I wish I were.$ That isn't what I mean, you silly Michael.$ You thought by telling me what you used to be... you could cure me of my love for you.$ Mary- - What you're saying isn't important now.$ It was true.$ It isn't true anymore.$ I'm even almost glad it's happened.$ Glad?$ I don't think I could've stood it if you hadn't had some kind of flaw, Michael.$ It's funny, you're trying to tell me you're not worthy of me, when all the time- - Oh, Mary.$ Before you called this morning, I tried to write a letter to Frank.$ He's fine, good, everything a man should be.$ And I don't love him.$ Mary, do you mean that in spite of every- -$ I do mean.$ The past is what it was for both of us.$ We love each other.$ Don't you see that's all that matters? Perhaps we can find a bench where- - Where we can talk?$ Where we can talk.$ And it was all fixed up for Michael to walk in and ask this guy... what he thought he was doing with his wife.$ Good for 5,000 bucks this guy was too.$ All right.Mike is supposed to walk in at 4: 00.$ And sharp 7: 00, he shows up.$ You can't imagine what I went through those three hours.$ Yes, I can.$ Well, you're wrong.$ Hurrah, a caller.$ Hello.$ Hello.$ Hmm, it talks.$ Say, not wanting to change the subject, but you were supposed to be here at 4: 00.$ I have something to say to you, Irene.$ Well, what am I supposed to do, handsprings?$ I think I'll blow along.$ Don't bother, Fred.$ Anything the district attorney has got to say to me, he can say in front of you.$ Oh, uh, excuse me for using the word" district attorney."$ I forgot you're very sensitive.$ I gotta go.$ You don't seem to hold your audiences somehow, Michael.$ And when you've finished,I want to talk to you seriously.$ Shoot.$ You know what I told you last night?$ You say so many things I can't remember them all.$ Try to think.$ You put a sort of riddle to me... and answered it yourself.$ You were a bit wrong in your answer.$ Miss Kendall and I are going to be married.$ On the level?$ On the level.$ And that goes in every way.$ And that's what I came to tell you.$ Thanks.$ Now I'll tell you something.$ You're not going to marry that girl, now or ever.$ Interesting, but untrue.$ I've told her all about myself.$ You see, interesting and true.$ Yes, I see.$ Don't bother inviting me to the wedding, Michael, because I'll be there anyway.$ I'll bring a couple of cops along for protection... and to pull you in as soon as the ceremony is performed.$ There are a lot of things the cops in this town would like to know, and I'm just the little lady that can tell them.$ I don't suppose you stopped to think of that.$ I have a notion you won't do that.$ You've been getting a lot of funny notions lately.$ And they're not healthy for you.$ You are what you are and you're never going to be able to change, because there are a lot of people you've done things to who won't let you.$ No matter if you stayed honest from now on until you died.$ I'm just like you are, only I ain't kidding myself.$ I don't intend to go on as I have.$ But you've got to, whether you want to or not.$ Let's say you're really in love with this girl.$ What kind of love do you think it is?$ Because you love her, are you gonna take her no matter what happens to her?$ I know, you love each other.$ That's all that matters, isn't it?$ She can spend five years, 1 0 years of her life as Mrs. Convict Trevor, or whatever one of your aliases they get you under.$ If I don't squeal, it doesn't have to be me, something will pop up one of these days and get you... and you know it.$ I don't know it.$ Oh, yes, you do.$ You're too smart not to have figured it all out for yourself.$ Why don't you take a little trip?$ She'll forget all about you in a month.$ Not that girl.$ You are what you are.$ Then what difference does it make?$ And you're never going to be able to change.$ Don't you see that's all that matters?$ Ten years ofher life as Mrs. Convict Trevor, and you know it.$ Never been in love in my life until then.$ You're too smart not to have figured it all out for yourself.$ What kind oflove do you think it is?$ Because you love her, are you gonna take her no matter what happens to her? I don't believe it.$ Frankly, I don't care whether you believe it or not.$ My only interest is in the amount of the check you're going to give me.$ It's preposterous.$ That's the fourth time you've said that.$ Say it again, and I walk out.$ You can't be serious about this.$ That first gag about holding me up on that item about me and that blonde.$ All right, I'll believe that.$ But you and Mary- -$ It's down there in black and white just like that other item.$ You can suit yourself about believing it, but that's the way it gets printed unless- -$ I ought to break every bone in your body.$ Well, in the first place, I don't think you can.$ And in the second place, the item gets printed whether you do or not.$ I've heard about your kind of scoundrel, but I really didn't believe he existed.$ Now you know.$ Hello.$ Michael.$ Just a minute.$ Why?$ What's the matter?$ Plenty.$ Read this.$ I don't understand.$ This rat is trying to- -$ That kind of talk will do you no good, except to raise the price.$ Price?$ He wants $ 1 0,000 to keep that out of a dirty scandal sheet he runs.$ It's some kind of joke.$ That's what I thought.$ You'll find out how much of a joke it is.$ Just a moment.$ According to this piece, yesterday you and I visited a cheap and notorious inn near Versailles.$ That's right.$ You know that this whole thing is a lie.$ You know that yesterday, we spent the morning... and most of the afternoon in the Bois.$ You remember that, don't you?$ The item speaks for itself.$ If the paper is wrong, I'm sure it will publish a retraction.$ Unfortunately, however, a retraction is seldom read... by all the people who read the original statement.$ This whole thing is a lie, and you propose to publish it, is that right?$ There's one way of stopping publication.$ May I speak to- - to Mr. Trevor alone?$ I prefer Mr. Taylor to remain in the room.$ I see.$ You are serious about this?$ Decidedly.$ If Mr. Taylor doesn't listen to reason, that item will be printed in the paper next week.$ I, uh, imagine Frank will be interested in reading it.$ I think that Frank's interests need concern you no longer.$ I don't see what we can do, Mary, except pay him.$ And the sooner you take care of it, the sooner I can be on my way.$ The sooner you get out ofhere, the better it suits me.$ Why did you tell me about yourself if you didn't mean what you said?$ If you weren't really- -$ You are a silly little girl, aren't you?$ Suppose someone had seen you with me before I had everything ready.$ They might have found out who I was and have told you.$ So I told you myself.$ I congratulate you.$ Here it is.$ Allow me.$ After all, he has me to thank for it.$ It'll be all right, Mary.$ It'll be all right.$ You'll forget all about it as soon as Frank gets back.$ Monsieur Trevor.Monsieur Trevor.$ Inspector Lyons from the prefecture of police.$ I will be brief.$ As a result of information supplied by a friend, we have today established the identity of the editor of the American Scandal Sheet, which has annoyed so many of your compatriots.$ However, the French government has no desire... to fill its jails with such undesirable foreigners.$ You would be conferring a favor upon this man... by letting him know that the police will call upon him tomorrow at this time.$ They would be pleased if they were unable to arrest him... because by that hour, he had left the frontiers of France behind him for all time.$ If they do arrest him, it will go very hard with him.$ Do you understand, Mr. Trevor?$ Yes, thoroughly.$ That will be all then until 4: 00 tomorrow.$ Going away?$ Long trip?$ Yes.$ Any place in particular?$ I was thinking of Cape Town.$ Africa, hmm?$ They say it's very nice there.$ I suppose you know that I tipped off the little lads of the law.$ So I guessed.$ I've been keeping tabs on you.$ You went to see her and her uncle at their hotel today.$ I did.$ I couldn't stand it any longer.$ Thinking of you and her.$ You were right about her.I, uh-$ -

3117281$ I wonder what's keeping him.$ You wouldn't be in a hurry either if you'd been fired, would you?$ The Reverend Fallon was not fired.$ Look, here comes his daughter.$ This morning my father was to have delivered his farewell sermon to you, but he has been ill, as you all know, and today he cannot be with you.$ But he dictated his sermon to me, as he has done for so many years.$ I have it here, and I'm going to read it to you.$ " Friends, I leave you today after a score of years in this church as a servant of the Lord, to whom I pray that he may let words of my mouth and troubled meditations of my heart be acceptable in his sight.$ I have baptized many of you in the Lord's grace, a few of you I have joined together in marriage, and over the bodies of some of your loved ones,$ I have spoken the beautiful, triumphant victory that comes with the Lord's salvation.$ I would dearly love to stay as your pastor for the rest of my years, for I had hoped to live and die at this pulpit.$ But you have seen fit to call another, a younger man to guide and serve you.$ And though I leave you, I do not leave the Lord.$ Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.$ And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.$ When the heart is thirsty, there is drink in the Testaments:$ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.$ He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.$ He leadeth me beside the still waters.$ He restoreth..."$ That's as far as he got.$ This is his farewell message to you.$ You see that he stopped in the middle of a sentence.$ My father is dead.$ He died in my arms five minutes ago, before he could finish his message to you, but I'm gonna finish it for him.$ Miss Fallon, the news you bring is painful, but I hardly think it proper...$ You're the head deacon of this church, Mr. Simpson, and I want you to listen to what I have to say, because it's your clique that started all this trouble.$ Leave if you like.$ My father preached to empty hearts.$ I don't mind talking to empty pews.$ My father is dead, and you killed him!$ You crucified him just as surely as he was crucified.$ He died of disappointment, of heartbreak, of ingratitude.$ He gave his life to serve you and when he was old and worn you threw him out.$ You all came to this church in automobiles.$ He always had to walk.$ He didn't even leave enough money, after 20 years of service to you, to buy a burial in a decent cemetery.$ This is not the time nor place to speak of such things, and I must ask you to remember you are in the house of God...$ What God?$ Whose God?$ Yours?$ This isn't the house of God, this is a meeting place for hypocrites.$ You're out of your head, and I, for one, will not listen to such...$ Well, go on, get out!$ You've been running this church, but I'm gonna run it for the next hour.$ I'm gonna preach the sermon my father should have preached.$ The Bible says the labourer is worthy of his hire.$ But you wouldn't pay your pastor what you pay your chauffeurs.$ I've worked for you too, without pay.$ I've served you by helping him, and you've got to listen to me.$ I don't have to make any notes either.$ I was brought up on the Bible, and I know it by heart.$ I'm gonna take my text this morning from chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew.$ And I say unto you as Christ said to the scribes and Pharisees,$ " Woe unto you

running away from?$ Are you afraid of the truth?$ Is that why you got rid of my father?$ You are thieves, killers, adulterers, blasphemers and liars six days a week.$ And on the seventh day, you are hypocrites.$ Go on, get out, all of you!$ Get out, so I can open these windows and let some fresh air into this church.$ Attababy!$ Attababy!$ What do you want?$ Believe it or not,I'm waiting for a train to take me out of this town.$ Hornsby is the name.$ I blew in this town by accident.$ And I don't mind telling you that I was thinking all the things you just said.$ This trip looked like a double zero to me, but I've got a hunch that it won't be a blank after all.$ I'd like to have a talk with you, Sister.$ Leave me alone.Get out of here.$ HORNSBY:Pardon me for horning in, Sister.$ I

them in the church a while ago,$ I don't suppose you wanna hang around here, do you?$ Where do you figure on going?$ Oh, I don't know.$ Please go.$ There's nothing you can do.$ Well, sorry.$ Thought I might be able to help, that's all.$ Thanks for being so kind.$ You ought to listen to me, Sister, because we're both in the same boat.$ I've got no plans either.$ No profession, no belief and no limit.$ But I have got one thing:$ A way to get along.$ And it works.$ You think you beat those people out there just now, don't you?$ Well, you didn't.$ They beat you.$ There's only one way to lick a mob.$ Join them.$ Now, wait a minute, Sister.$ Let me finish.$ You're not a hypocrite if you admit it.$ The thing is, be on the winning side.$ Play percentage.$ Most of the trouble in this world comes from people who have convictions.$ The answer is, don't have any.$ If you have none, you can assume the ones that happen to pay.$ You're sore at those people because they fired your old man, and it killed him.$ You wanna get back at them, don't you?$ Well, I can tell you how to do it, and get famous and get rich and what's more... get even.$ Interested?$ I'm listening.$ Okay, now let's get organized.$ First of all, what do you know?$ You know the Bible by heart.$ You can pull nifties out of it like raisins.$ Your old man was a preacher.$ And you've got hot spiel in your blood.$ It was

good-natured man if you'll treat me as such.$ Now, you take me on as a neighbor... and all that, and i'll manage withou t chimneys in the centry.$ Here, is it a bargain?$ Not if you'd bought the centry 10 times over.$ Your ways are not mine.$ I'll have nothing to do with you.$ Really?Is that so?Very well.$ Now you are going to learn some things, and it's time you did.$ Do you realize that i'm very nearly around you?$ Eh?I'm at... up hill.The works are here.$ Here's the centry, that i've just bought.$ So my goods will be running right round you.$ How will you like that for a country place?$ Eh?That's not a bit sporting of you, mr.$ Hornblower.$ Well... you should hear both sides before you say that, missy.$ There isn't anothe r side to turning out the jackmans after you promised... oh, dear me, yes.$ Why, they don't matter a row of gingerbread compared to the schemes i've got for bettering this neighborhood.$ I had been standing up for you.$ Now i won't.$ Oh, dear, dear.What'll become of me, eh?$ I won't say anything about the other thing, because i think it's beneath dignity to notice it, but to turn poor people out of their cottage is a shame.$ Hoity me!Jill!$ Well, what's the good?$ Life's too short for rows.$ Now, now, look here.$ You'll just have to learn that a man who's worked as i have, risen as i have, and who knows the world is the proper judge of what's right and wrong.$ I'll answer to god for my actions, not to you, young lady.$ You blasphemous young thing.$ Jill, i wish you'd kindly not talk.$ I don't think i want to say anything more to you, hornblower.$ Good morning.$ All right.$ We'll play what you call a skin game, hillcrist, without gloves on.$ You look out for yourselves.By god, after this morning, i mean business.$ Where's my hat?$ Good-bye.$ Say that i'm here, will you?$ Dawker, sir.$ Well... dawker?$ Safe, for the moment.$ The old lady will put it up to auction.$ Couldn't get her to budge from that.$ Said she didn't want to be unneighborly.Ask me, it's money she smells.$ Can i see you alone for a moment, please, ma'am?$ It's rather important.$ I bet dawker's up to no good.I can tell by his expression.$ I don't like dawker, father.$ He's so common.$ My dear, we can't all be uncommon.$ And he's got lots of dough.$ I bet they've got some scheme on that'll make you do things you don' t approve of if you don't look out.$ Mother's fearfully bitter when she gets her knife in.$ If old hornblower' s disgusting, there's no reason why we should be.$ So you think i'm capable?$ That's nice, jill.$ No, no, darling.$ But i want to warn you solemnly ir that mother would tell you you're fighting fa no matter what she and dawker do.$ Jill, i never saw you so serious.$ Well... hey!Sorry.I was just beginning to enjoy myself, now everything's going to be bitter and beastly with mother in that mood.$ That horrible old man.$ Oh, daddy, i... don't let them make you horrid.$ How's your gout, ducky?$ Better, a lot better.$ There, you see?That shows.It's going to be half interesting for you, not for us.$ Look here, jill, is there anything between you and this young what's-his-name rolf?$ No, but... now it's all spoiled.$ You don't expect me to regret that.I don't mean any tosh about love's young dream, but i do like being friends.$ I want to enjoy things, and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate.$ You're going to wallow in it.So shall i.$ Oh, i know i shall.$ We shall all wallow and think of nothing but one for his nob.$ Aren't you fond of your home?$ Of course.$ I love it.$ Well, you won't be abl e to live here unless we stop that ruffian.$ Imagine it.$ Chimneys and smoke, all the trees cut down, piles of pots all over the place.$ You know, i was born here and my father and his and his.$ They loved those fields and the old trees.$ Do you know i learned to ride in the centry meadows?Prettiest spring meadows in the world.$ You may go through life and never find anything so good and beautiful as this old home, and i'm not going to have it spoiled without a fight.$ I told you!$ I knew perfectly well what he told me...$ Well, lad, how are you?$ Hey, dad!$ i'll just get the.$ I say, do you see old hornblower and his son charlie?$ Oh, look.There's chloe.$ You know, charlie's wife standing with rolf.$ I say, rolf, just leave me alone for a moment, would you?$ All right.$ What did that woman mean by insulting you like that?$ Wonderful improvement we're having in the town, ma'am.$ I did hear we're having the electric lights soon.$ Mrs. Hillcrist.$ I beg your pardon?$ Mrs. Hillcrist, I... well?$ I haven't done you any harm.$ Did i ever say you had?$ No, but you act as though i had.$ I'm not aware that i acted at all... as yet.$ You're nothing to me except as one of your family.$ It isn't as if i want to spoil your home.$ Stop them, then.$ I see your husband out there with his father.$ I'll try.$ I suppose such men pay no attention to what women are.$ I'm fond of my husband i don't quite know why you spoke to me.$ I only thought you might like to treat me as a human being.$ Really, i... i'd rather you left me alone just now, if you don't mind.$ Very well.$ I'll move further up.$ Excuse me.$ Get up, dawker.$ In case i don't see the squire, would you ask him when i come to his limit, blow his nose if he wants me to go on.And when he blows the second time,$ I'll stop for good what limit did you settle?$ £ ³ 6,000.$ That's a fearful price.$ From the ground... from the ground, you see that chap i told you about come down from town.$ He's a fellow who can tell us all about young mrs.$ H.Watch me cross over, you'll see me stand beside him.$ Hello.$ Jack, i've just seen dawker.He says if you want to go about 6,000, blow your nose once.When you blow it the second time, he'll take it as a signal to stop bidding altogether.$ I see.$ I say, look.$ Jack, go and offer her my smelling salts.$ Thank god for human touch.$ I say, have a sniff.$ You look awfully white.$ No, i'm all right.$ Thank you.$ No, no, do.$ You must.$ I'll get you some water.$ Now, you know, i've only one property to sell.$ That very desirable corn and stock-rearing and parklike

nicely timbered, no reservation of timber.Gentlemen, no tenancy to hold you up, free to do what you like with it tomorrow.$ And you've got a jewel of a site there, too.$ Perfect position for a house.$ Lies between the dukes and squire hillcrist's.$ An emerald isle.$ No allusion to our ireland gentlemen.Perfect peace in the centry.$ Nothing like it in the county.$ Carries the mineral rights, and as

well, i'm not particular.$ Anything you'd like to give me come on, you've got more time than me, i expect.$ Come on.$ 200 acres of first rate grazing and corn land.And a site for a residence unequaled

charles hornblower doesn't seem very upset.$ Phew!$ Well, ha ha.You ran me up a pretty price.$ That's a bit very good, hillcrist.$ But you didn't quite get my million.$ Ha ha.It's just my 9,000 that you kept.$ Thank god the centry's gone to a gentleman.$ Ha!The duke!$ Nah.$ The centry's not gone to a gentleman, nor to a fool.$ It's gone to me.$ What?$ I'm sorry for you.$ You're not fit to manage these things.$ Well, it's a monstrous price, and i've had to pay it because of your obstinacy.$ I shan't forget that when i come to bill.$ You mean to say that last bid was for you?$ Well, of course i do.$ I told you i was a bad man to be up against.$ Perhaps you believe me now.$ A trick!$ Trick?$ You had an agent bid for you.I had an agent bid for me.$ Only your agent bid at the beginning, and mine bid at the end.$ What's the trick in that, eh?$ What did you call it?A skin game?$ Remember, we're playing a skin game.$ If we were younger men... aw, it wouldn't look pretty for us to be at fisticuffs.$ We'll leave the fighting for the young ones.$ And as for you, missy, you leave my boy alone.$ Dada... may i spit it his eye or something?$ You won this round, sir, by a foul blow.$ We'll see who can take advantage of it.$ I believe the law can stop your ruining my property.$ Mr. Hornblower?Will you fight foul, so shall we.$ We will not be foul played towards you and yours.$ You're outside the pale.$ Well, as we're speaking out, ma'am, it's your behavior to my daughter-in-law, who's as good as you and better to my way of thinking, that's more than half the reason why i bought this property.$ You fair got my dander up.$ Mr. Hornblower, if you build... you know, it's laughable.$ You make me pay $ 9,500 for a bit of land not worth 4, and you think i'm not going to get back on me?$ Why, i'm going on with as little consideration as if you were a family of black beetles.$ All right, drive on.$ No, stop!$ And mother's in the secret, too.What did you ask dawker, dada?$ Dawker!$ What's this mystery about young mrs.Hornblower?$ No mystery, sir.$ What is it?$ Better not ask in front of jill.$ Oh, nonsense.$ It's not for a girl to hear.$ What load of rot!$ I read the papers every day.$ No worse to see in there anyway.$ Do you want your daughter... you think i was mother at my age.$ I was not so proud of my knowledge.$ No, but you had it.$ Now, what is it?What is it?$ Come here a minute, dawker.$ Well, whatever it is about chloe, i'm sorry for her.$ How do you know this?$ My friend over there is one of the agents, sir.$ Shocking.$ I'm sorr y i heard it.$ I told you not to.$ Tell your friend to come here.$ Are you sure of what you said?$ Perfectly.$ I remember her quite well.Her name then was... i don't want to know, thank you.$ It's not to be spoken of.$ It will not be spoken of that mr.$ He is not wise?$ I won't have it.$ To use a piece of knowledge about a woman?It's repugnant.$ I won't do it.$ If you had a son tricked into marrying such a woman, would you wish to remain ignorant of it?$ I don't know.$ I don't know.You realize... that an implication of this kind may be grounds for a criminal libel action.$ Quite.There's not a shadow of doubt.Not the faintest.$ You saw her just now.$ Yes.$ I did.$ I don't like it.$ Good day.$ Chloe!$ Chloe!$ Chloe.$ Hornblower is looking for you, madam.$ Shall i tell... i'll tell mr.$ How's the head oh, beastly, thanks.$ I say, let's go in the study for a minute.$ I've got dawker waitin g by the garage now.$ He says he can only stay a few minutes.$ I say, are you sure it's all right?$ You don't want this quarrel with hillcrist to go on, do you, rolf?$ No, i hate it.$ Well, i think perhaps i can stop it.That's why...$ Hello.What you doing in here, eh?$ How're you feeling, chloe?$ Oh, awful head.$ Have you?$ Hey, i'm sorry.$ Can you tend a moment?$ I've had a note from that woman.$ Well, what's the meaning of it, eh?$ Is it sheer impudence or lunacy or what?$ I don't know.$ If there's anythin you better tell me.$ Forewarned is forearmed, you know.$ There's nothing...$ Sorry.Unless it's that my father was a bankrupt.$ Well, many a man has been that.$ You've never told us much about your family.$ It's just... i wasn't very proud of them.$ What were you going to say, rolf?$ Oh, nothing.$ Oh.Well, you're n ot responsible for your father, hmm?$ No.$ No, if that's the one, it's a relief oh, the bitter snobs.$ I'll remember it in the account i've got with them don't say anything to charlie.$ Do not worry him for nothing.$ Oh, no, no, no.$ Ha!$ Why, if i went bankrupt, it'd upset charlie, i'd never doubt.$ Now, there's nothi ng else before i answer her, hmm?$ You sure?She might invent things, of course.$ Ah, but there's a such thing as the laws of slander.$ If they play pranks, i'll have them up for it.$ There's dinner.$ Come on.$ No, i don't think i'll go in to dinner.My head's terrible.$ Is it?$ Aw.I'll just go into the garden for a bit and then have a liedown.$ Why are you going that way?$ Oh, i'm all right.$ Are you?Are you sure?$ Shall we send you something up from dinner?$ All right.$ Good night, chloe.$ Good night, dad.$ I'll tell charlie where you are.$ Well, ma'am, what do want with me?$ Wait a moment.I'll stop that dog barking.$ Here, lie down.$ Lie down.$ You're making a mistake, you know.$ No.I have a good memory for faces.$ If that's all, you needn't have told me to come.$ Oh, don't go.$ You are playing a game with me.$ Aren't you ashamed?What harm have i done you?$ You call this cricket?$ No, my girl.$ Business.$ What have i to do with this quarrel?$ I couldn't help their falling out.$ It's your misfortune.$ You're a rotter if you can spoil anyone's life who never did you an ounce of harm.$ Oh, so they don't know about you, eh?$ Well, that's all right.$ now, look here, mrs.Chloe.$ I serve my employer, but i'm flesh and blood, too.And i give as good as i get.$ I hate this family of yours.$ There's no name too bad for them to call me this last week, no looks too bad to give me.$ I tell you frankly, i hate them.$ There's good in them, same as in you.$ Ah, there's no good hornblower but a dead hornblower.$ But i'm not one?$ No, but you'll be the mother of some, i shouldn't wonder.$ Oh, leave me alone, do?$ I'm happy here.Be a sport.$ Oh, be a sport.$ You can't get round me, so don't try to.$ Oh, it's such a bad time in the old days.$ Oh, do.$ You might.You've been fond of some woman, i suppose.$ Think of her.$ Now, look here, mrs.Chloe.You're only a small fry in this game, u.$ But i've got to use yo look here.$ Don't you make an enemy of me.$ I haven't been dragged through hell for nothing.Women like me can fight, i can tell you.$ Ah, that's better.$ I'd rather have a woman threaten than whine any day.$ Go on, threaten away.$ Look, there's some money.It's all i've got.$ Take it and drop me out, won't you?$ You mistake your man, missy.$ Don't you try those games on with me.$ Oh, you're a beast.$ A beast.A cruel, cowardly beast.$ And how dare you bribe my man to spy on me.$ Oh, yes, you do.$ You know you do.If you drove me mad, you wouldn't care, you beast.$ Don't carry on.$ It won't get you anywhere.$ I hope your mother and your sisters if you have any are going through what i've been going through ever since you got on my track.$ I hope they'll know what fear means.$ I hope they'll love and find it's hanging on a thread.$ Oh, you coward.$ You bastard.$ Calling yourself a man.$ Oh, you're quite pretty like that.$ You're a handsome woma n when you're aroused.$ Is there anything you'll take not to mess up my life?$ Now, look here, mrs.Chloe.$ I've got to go through with this.$ I don't want anything you can give me, but i'll let you down as lightly as i can.$ Chloe!$ Hello, chloe.What are you doing here?$ I've been looking for you all over the place.$ I thought i heard someone talking.No.$ I think i'll go to my room now and have a liedown.$ My head's splitting.$ Aye, sure.$ It's damn cold out here.$ I say, what, uh... what gives you these heads?$ I don't know.$ Except that i am going to have a child, charlie.$ What?$ Of course.I mean, i suppose i am.$ It seems funny, somehow, you would be having a kid.The governor will be mighty pleased, anyway.$ Oh, don't tell him yet.$ All right, poor old girl.$ I saw you not well.$ Kiss, kiss.You're like fire.Are you all right?$ Oh, not so bad.$ Are you happy with me, charlie?$ What do you think?$ You wouldn't easily believe things against me, would you?$ Oh, you're thinking of those hillcrists again.$ What the hell that woman means by her attitude towards you, I... when i saw her there today, i had all my work out but to give her a bit of my mind.$ This quarrel's getting on my nerves.$ Yes, and we won't forget.$ We'll make them pay for it.$ Oh!$ I didn't mean that can't you get your father to stop it, charlie?$ Whatever for?$ Now, look here, chloe.Here, do this.What's behind all this?$ What do you mean?$ You're carrying on as if you were really scared.$ Here, come sit down.I tell you, we've got these people.Why, they'll have them out of deepwater in 6 months.$ It's absolute ruination to their beastly old house.We'll put our chimneys on the very edge, not 300 yards off.$ And our smoke will be drifting right over them.$ Won't have this confounded, stuck-up woman here much longer.$ And then we can really go ahead and take our proper place.$ So long as she's here, we shall never do that.$ We've only got to drive on now as fast as we can.$ I see.$ You know, if you go on like this, i shall begin to think that... charlie!$ There.You want a good rest, that's all.$ You haven't started your dinner yet, have you?$ You go down and i'll go to bed quite soon.$ Don't stop loving me, charlie.$ Stop?$ Not much.$ Seeing you yesterday at the auction did seem rotten.$ We didn't begin it.$ No, but you don't understand.$ If you've made yoursel f as father has... i hope i should be sorry.$ Now, that's not like you.$ He can't help thinking he's a public benefactor.$ And we can't help thinking he's a pig.$ Oh, sorry.$ If the survival of the fittest is right... he may be the fitter, but he isn't going to survive.$ It looks like it though.$ Is that all you came to say?$ No.$ Couldn't... couldn't we join together?Couldn't we stop it?$ I don't feel like joining.$ Well, we did shake hands.$ You can't fight and not grow bitter.$ I don't feel bitter.$ You will soon enough.$ Why?$ Oh, chloe.$ I do think your mother'''s manner to her is... well?$ Well, snobbish.$ She may not be in your class, but that's just why it's snobbish.$ I think you better shut up.$ What my father said was true.Your mother's rudeness to her yesterday has made both he and charlie ever so much bitter.$ Is this a whistling matter?$ No.$ I suppose you want me to go.$ Yes.$ Aren't we ever going to be friends again?$ I don't expect so.$ That's very horrible.$ Lots of horrible things in this world.$ It's up to us to make them pure, jill.$ And be immoral?$ That's the last thing i want to be.$ I only want to be friendly.$ That would be a real first.$ Yes, but... but from the big point of view... there isn't any.$ We're all out for our own.$ And why not?$ By jove, you have got... cynical?$ Each man for himself.$ That's the winner, hands down.$ Good-bye.Jill.$ Jill.$ Should old acquaintance be forgot for the...?$ All right, i'll go and tell her.$ Excuse me, madam.$ Mr. Dawker's here... now, this may come into court, you know, so if there's a weak point in any way, better administer it at once.$ You are absolutely sure of the girl?$ There's no question of it.$ Here's a cutting of the actual case.$ Come this way.$ Morning, ma'am.$ I brought my friend's partner with me.$ Is mr.Hornblower coming?$ At 11: 00.$ But only after i had sent up a second note to him.$ Squire's not in?$ L... i haven't told him.$ Well, i think our friends might wait in there, then we can use them when we want to.$ Will you make yourselves comfortable?$ I've had this drawn and engrossed.$ Pretty smart work.$ It conveys that centry added long meadow to the squire for 4,500.$ Now, mum, if hornblower puts his hand to that, he'll have been done in the eye and 6,000 out of pocket.$ You will have a very nasty neighbor there.$ But we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any time?$ Yeah, but things may happen you can't bring home to him.$ You can't trust a man like that.$ He isn't likely to forgive me, i know.$ But if he signs, we couldn't honor that.$ No, no, ma'am.$ I'm sure i don't want to do that girl a hurt.$ I only mention it because of course, you can't guarantee that it won't get out.$ Not absolutely, i suppose.$ That's his car.$ It always seems to make more noise than any other.$ But you leave him to us what you want.And uh, i wouldn't mention this.$ The centry's no mortal good to him if he can't put up works.$ I reckon he'll be glad to save what he can.$ Mr. Hornblower to see you, madam, by appointment, he says.$ I will discuss it in the presence of nobody, if you please.$ Mr. Dawker knows just as much as i do, and more.$ Does he?$ Very well.Your second note says that my daughter-in-law has lied to me.$ Well, i've brought her.$ , and what you've got to say if it's not just a trick to see me again, you will say to her face.$ Mr. Hornblower, you'd better decide that after hearing what it is.We shall be quite ready to repeat it in her presence, but... we want to do as little harm as possible... oh.$ You do, do you?$ Well, what lies have you been hearing, eh?$ Or what have you made up?You and mr.Dawker.$ I suppose you know there's such a thing as the law of libel and slander.$ I'm not the man to stoop at that.$ Are you familiar with the law of divorce, mr.$ Hornblower?$ No, i'm not.$ Well, in that case... no misconduct is required.$ I suppose you've heard that cases are arranged.$ I know it's all very shocking.What about it?$ Some cases are arranged, mr.$ Hornblower.The man who is to be divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman.$ I'm extremely sorry to have to say that your daughter-in-law, before her marriage, was in the habit of being employed as such a woman.$ It's all proved up to the hilt.$ You're lying to save your skins!$ How dare you tell me such monstrosities!$ Dawker, i'll have you in a criminal court!$ Oh, rats.You saw the gentleman that was with me yesterday?$ Well, he's employed her.$ A put up job, sir!$ A conspiracy!$ Go and fetch your daughter-in-law.$ It's a foul shame.A lying slander.And so it's easily disproved.$ Go and fetch her.$ I will.$ Now, then, let's have this impudent story torn to rags.$ What story?$ You, my dear.$ When a woman who... oh, it's too shocking.$ I don't know how to tell you.$ Go on.$ When a woman that went with men to get them their divorce.$ Who says that?$ That lady here.$ And her bull terrier there.That's a charitabl e thing to say, isn't it?$ Is it true?$ No!$ Here, i'll have you both on your knees to her.$ How do you do, mrs.$ I don't know you.$ You've got a bad memory, ma'am.$ You knew me well enough yesterday.$ A day's not a long time, nor 3 years.$ Who are you?$ I don't know you, i say.$ Let me refresh your memory, ma'am just on 3 years ago,$ " october 3, fee and expenses mrs.Vane with mr.C.$ October 10, ditto.£ ³ 20."$ If you like to have a look at the book, sir, you'll see the entries are quite genuine.$ No.$ It's lies, a lot of lies.$ Come, ma'am.We wish you no harm.$ Take me away.I won't be treated like this.$ Lies!$ Were you ever called vane?$ No, never!$

Well, what is it?$ - Not much.$ Just this.$ I want you to get me those gold keys that Nick's customers use for his gambling...$ I won't.$ - I haven't finished, Miss Graham.- I don't care, I won't do it.$ You can send me up.$ Now, don't be foolish.$ It's a case of you or him.$ He'll never know you did it.$ I won't.I won't!$ Now, don't get excited.$ All we wanna do is to give Nick a good scare.$ He'll be out in a month.$ That wouldn't hurt him at all.$ While if you went to the penitentiary for a long sentence...$ But he's the only the person that's ever been kind to me.$ He's a public menace.$ He's trying to corrupt public officials.$ He's even put his filthy hands on policemen, state's attorneys.$ - And even made overtures to our judges.$ - I can't help it.$ Leave me alone.$ Please don't make me do it.$ Oh, please.$ - Have you a key, sir?$ - Sure.$ All bets down.$ You look swell, baby.$ You got class.$ That's what I like about you.$ I think you're about the prettiest little thing I've ever seen.$ And the sweetest.$ - I'm not what you think I am, Nick.$ - What, not sweet?$ Don't tell me, I know.$ Nick used to be a sugar taster.$ I've got something for you.$ There.$ Here.$ Doesn't that look nice there?$ - I can't take it, Nick.$ - Oh, yes, you can.$ And what's more, before long, I'm gonna give you a ring.$ For that finger.$ What's the matter, honey?$ - You're shaking like a leaf.$ - I'm all upset tonight, Nick.$ Have you a key, sir?$ No, we're with headquarters.$ Go on, break in.$ It's a raid.$ Get rid of the gun.$ It's a raid.$ You stay right here.$ Go get him.Get up.$ I thought so.$ It was you who let those coppers in.$ You dirty little stool pigeon.$ - Oh!What's this all about?$ Lay off, Nick.$ She's planting evidence on you.$ She put it in the inside coat pocket.- I'm telling you, now look for yourself.$ Why, it's nothing but a racing form, you smack-off.$ Lay off, I'm telling you.Quit it.$ I'm trying to steer you straight.Steer you straight.$ - I'm gonna let you have it.$ - Yes.You won't.$ Yeah, I'll show him, treating you like that.$ Come on, Nick.$ Let's go downtown.$ What for?$ You got nothing on me.$ I'm just a guest here, like a hundred others.$ I like your company.$ You can't hang anything on me.$ I don't own this place.$ Look up the deed in the Recorder's Office.$ - You don't, eh?$ All I own here is what I've got on.$ We like your company.$ It's hot and stuffy here.$ Let's take a walk.$ You got good manners for cops.Heh-heh.$ All right, I'll oblige you.$ For all the good it's gonna do you.Heh-heh.$ All you've got here is what you got on.$ - Is that it, Nick?$ - Yeah, that's it.$ Then you've got plenty.$ That's nothing but a racing form.$ You probably don't know there's an old blue law that classifies a racing form as gambling paraphernalia.$ Makes possession of one punishable by a six-month jail sentence.$ I didn't know it myself till just a few days ago.$ But I know it now, Nick.$ And so do you.$ - Why, you dirty, you double-crosser...$ - What's the matter with this fellow?$ And I'm darned sorry.$ He didn't have it coming.$ - He's unconscious.$ - Let's be going, Nick.$ - This fellow isn't unconscious.He's dead.$ - What's that?$ Look out, here.$ Jack!$ Jack, I'm talking to you.$ It looks like manslaughter or murder now, Nick.$ - So you gave me the works, huh?$ - Yes, Nick.$ I did it.$ But I didn't think it would be for anything like this.$ I've always been a little coward.$ Oh, Nick, could you ever forgive me?$ That's all right, Irene.$ I've always been a sucker for women.$ Come on, Black.Let's go.$ Hold it for a picture, Nick.$ - Oh, sure, just a minute.$ All right.$ Thanks.$ Yeah, Snake Eyes.$ I brought Blondie along.$ Thought you might like to say goodbye.$ Hey, you sure I can't take her along with me?$ Nothing doing.$ No blonds where you're going, Nick.$ Well, Blondie, no use two of us going up there, eh?$ - Take this rabbit's foot, boss.$ - Not a chance.$ You gave me one of those once before.$ I didn't mean no harm, because I loves you, Mr. Nick.$ Here's the way to give me luck.$ So long, Snake Eyes.$ I'll be seeing you.$ Come on over, Marie, the water's fine.$ I suppose I should be glad you're going up, Nick after the way you've treated me.But I'm not.$ I came down here to laugh in your face but I can't.$ Oh, that's all right, Marie.$ You're a swell guy.$ I deserved what I got.$ Oh, that's all right, Marie.$ I'm sorry the way everything turned out between us.$ I guess somebody must have been dealing from the bottom.$ Well, here.$ Buy yourself a box of candy.$ You know I don't eat it.It gets in my teeth.Heh-heh-heh.$ All aboard.- Yeah.$ Come on, Nick, let's go.$ - I'll be seeing you.$ Heh.Hey, Nick, bye-bye.$ I'll be seeing you.$ Any final statement, Nick?$ - Sure.$ Tell my public I've put the close clippers on other fellas before this.$ And now I'm gonna find out what it's like myself.$ I wonder how I'll look with that monkey haircut they give you there.$ Hey, Nick.How about a picture?$ All right, just a minute.$ I'll tell you when.$ - All right.$ - Good.$ So long, Nick.$ See you in 10 years.$ Ten years?$ I'll bet you 2-to-1 I'm out in five.$

to whom nothing ever happens!$ I might just as well be dead as alive.$ I think I'll get myself a gigolo..$ You have his Excellency to console you.$ If you think.. that Alfred von Gronac is any consolation, you're mistaken.$ Do you really believe he's taught me the depths of passion and the heights of love?$ Well, of course I can hardly be a judge of that.$ But his Excellency is a man of the world.He has seen everything.$ That's just it!$ He's seen too much!$ What dress shall I lay out, Madame?$ ─ Oh anything.$ Something old, black and dreary.$ ─ Yes, Madame.$ What's the matter?$ ─ Oh.. nothing.$ What's in that newspaper?$ Give it to me.$ ─ Don't read it dear, don't read it.$ Hmm Linden..$ Linden goes to Berlin.$ Yes, Maida Linden, now mezzo soprano goes to Berlin.$ But how?$ Why?$ ─ She will sing there, she says.$ In the hope of being heard by Fletcher, the American impresario I told you about.$ So she can't wait for Fletcher to come here.$ She can't go to Berlin.She's singing with us next week.$ I believe she has been granted a holiday.$ A holiday?$ ..What for?$ His Excellency.. as a personal favor.$ Rudig.. you've tormented me enough for one afternoon.You and your silly gossip.And now you're going much too far.$ Very well, very well, if you don't want to know.That Linden is having a guest to dinner tonight.$ One guest.. only one.$ ─ How do you know?$ My housekeeper and Linden's maid are cousins.$ Did your cousin tell you that Albert was dining with Linden?$ I don't want to gossip.$ ─ Did she?$ Yes!$ It's a lie.$ I'll be studying tonight.Later, we'll go to the German Embassy.$ His Excellency, Madame..$ Good afternoon, good afternoon.$ ─ Good afternoon, good afternoon.$ And how is my little songbird today?$ And the dear, faithful dog-friend.How we getting along Fido?$ Thanks very much for your gratifying interest Excellency.$ I manage to keep a kennel over my head.$ ─ Good, good.$ Pity me, dear child.I came to say how sorry I am I can't take you out tonight.$ I have an important engagement at the government office.$ If you'll excuse me, I'll hurry along.I must get some dog-biscuits.Excellency.. goodbye.$ I think I must be hurrying along, too.$ ─ Sit down Albert, I want to talk to you.$ Has anything happened, darling?$ Albert, we've been engaged for three years.$ That's a long time..$ ─ Patience Nella, a little more patience.$ I can assure you I respect you quite as much as though you were my wife.$ You respect me so much, that you're dining with Maida Linden tonight.Alone..$ Albert, you are having an affair with Maida Linden!$ No.. now, now, don't be angry.$ Really, I must laugh you know.. hahaha.$ Who told..?$ Who told you this ridiculous gossip?$ ─ It was Linden herself.She should know.$ Linden?..$ Impossible.$ ─ Are you telling me that I'm lying?$ Last night, she came to my dressing-room.That's how I found out.$ Well, as a director of the Opera House, I must take an interest in art mustn't I?$ An" interest in art"?So that's what you call it.$ Art?Art?Well, that's merely a word.$ Yes, and so is" untrue" a word, and so is" hypocrisy" and so is" liar"!$ Look here dove..$ Now darling, I'm not going to lie to you.Because that would only put me in an undignified position.$ Now, my dear child, I will confess that my acquaintance with Linden..Has not been.. entirely official.$ Now there.. see how frank I am?$ How I trust you?$ That should prove how fond I am of you.$ ─ And you dare to tell me all this!$ Oh darling, look here, I adore you, but three years?That's a long time.$ ─ Yes, it's three long years..$ It's the way of human nature, that's all.$ It's like..$ look here darling.Even if a man has a wonderful French cook in his house..Occasionally, he might like to dine at a restaurant.$ The food of the restaurant is fine of course.$ But he goes for, shall we say: variety.$ ─ Variety?$ Yes, especially when he's become accustomed to cold-cuts at home.$ Cold-cuts do very well for people who have neither taste nor appetite.$ If you find yourself in a better mood, you may call me tomorrow.$ Good day.$ Madame!$ Madame!$ That's genuine Delft.$ ─ You mean it was..$ Please Madame..$ A black gown?$ You wouldn't dress me in black on an evening like this.$ Madame.. it's a beautiful dress.$ You told me yourself I should bring it to you.$ You would wear it.$ Oh Emma.$ Lay out my new white satin.And the wrap that goes with it.$ ─ But Madame..$ I'll wear my emeralds, my earrings.. and all my bracelets.$ Emma.$ And my new French lingerie.$ I must be all.. white.. and glistening.$ Conrad.$ Yes Madame?$ ─ I want the car at 9 o'clock.$ Very well Madame.$ ─ Now wait a minute.$ Order a taxi.$ ─ Is Madame sure she wants a taxi?$ Quite sure.$ ─ Yes, Madame.$ And call the German Embassy and present my regrets.I'm ill.$ Oh and the florist Conrad..$ order a corsage of lilies.$ No, no.That would be too much.$ Order gardenias.$ ─ Very well Madame.$ I've had plenty of chicken sandwiches on dry toast.$ Tonight I will dine in a restaurant.$ Madame Vago's man speaking.How much are gardenias?$ I want a dozen, I want two dozen.$ I want a very large corsage.$ Gardenias are very expensive Madame.$ I ordered six.$ Six?$ Here I am, starting for paradise and you expect me to economize on the trip.$ Send six gardenias.$ Yes, that's the right number.. six$ Where is that music coming from?$ Oh it's that new gypsy orchestra playing downstairs in the garden.$ You naughty boy.. you haven't sweetened it.$ Oh dear.$ Delicious.. close the window..$ the music is too exciting for me.$ I know the real reason you're not at the Opera tonight you know.$ Oh you do?$ Clever woman..suppose you tell me.$ Because Nella Vago is not singing.$ Now come, own up, that's true isn't it?$ Well, there's nobody else in this Opera house worth listening to.$ I cannot understand you.$ You!Usually so un-impressionable, and now..$ What do you see in this woman?$ ─ I don't know.$ There is something about her I can't put out of my mind.$ She leaves me absolutely unmoved.$ She's always asleep, even when she's awake.$ Oh yes, but if she'd only wake up.$ If something or someone would..would only rouse her, shake her.$ You'd like to be the alarm clock, eh?$ I know.$ Oh can't I admire an artist without an outburst from you?$ It's not the artist you're admiring.$ It's the woman.$ Now don't be jealous.$ ─ Jealous?I..?$ I'm never jealous.. no..$ Only every day, over every new face I see.$ Well, you have left me a great deal alone, lately.$ Is that a new melody?$ Yes Madame.It's called" Tell me tonight".$ " Tell me tonight".$ It's lovely.. beautiful.$ Thank you.$ The doctor tells me to associate with young, younger.. people.$ " Youthful interests".. he calls it.$ Of course, my commonsense tells me I can never be sixteen again.$ I don't know.. with you, anything is possible.$ Goodnight.$ Well?$ ─ Well?$ Well, don't I get one tiny, little kiss before I go to bed?$ Of course you do.$ Sleep well.. and don't dream about beautiful young women.$ I won't..$ I'll dream about very, very handsome young men.$ Goodnight dear.$ ─ Goodnight darling.$ Goodnight dear.$ ─ Goodnight.$ Anything else, sir?$ ─ No.$ Excuse me, sir.I uh..$ ─ That's all.$ I..I think perhaps there is something you should know sir.$ Oh really.. what is it?$ I'm afraid it may be a little indiscreet sir.$ It's about a lady.$ Well don't so mysterious.Let's hear it.$ ─ If you please, sir..This evening, a lady came into the dining-room all alone.$ Well, go on.$ What's this got to do with me?$ What lady was it that..$ I you please sir.. it was Madame Nella Vago from the opera.Yes?Well, get on with it.$ She asked me on what floor is the apartment of Madame Marchesa?$ This lady doesn't know the Marchesa.$ And she wants to call on her now, at night?$ No sir, it's not the Marchesa she wishes to see.$ It's you sir.$ ─ Me?$ Madame Vago wants to see me?$ ─ She wishes to see you alone, sir.$ Oh very well.I'll go down at once.$ Oh no, sir.She wishes to come up here to you, sir.$ She.. she asked me to tell her when the Marchesa went to bed, sir.$ She told me not to mention the matter to you sir..$ But I thought perhaps I'd better.$ Oh.. yes, yes of course.$ Of course, I could say that you've gone to bed too sir, if you like.$ Oh no, don't do that.. no, merely tell her that I'm alone.$ Yes sir.$ If you could manage to be just a little bit surprised..$ Well..I am surprised.$ Oh waiter.. just take the latch off that outer door, will you.$ Yes, sir.$ Madame..$ Is Mrs Jackson in?$ Mrs Jackson?$ ─ They live here.$ Oh.. he's been out looking for the American Consul's wife.$ Yes.. this is their apartment, isn't it?$ Well, the Jackson's are on the floor above, Madame.$ Oh I'm so sorry..$ I beg your pardon.$ The elevator-boy let me off, I never looked.I just rushed in.$ Stupid of him.─ Yes, ma'am.$ Of course, if he had a great deal of intelligence..He wouldn't be an elevator boy.. would he?$ No Madame..$ And uh.. in a hotel.. all the floors look the same.They do, don't they?$ ─ Yes, Madame.$ Well then, I.. hope you'll pardon my intrusion.$ I suppose I'll have to go up to the next floor.$ I'm on my way to see the Jacksons.$ ─ Oh really?$ We're very good friends.$ ─ Oh indeed?$ Then I'm surprised that Madame doesn't know that the Jacksons have gone away.$ Yes, they've been in Paris for a week.$ Really?$ Oh this is dreadful..$ I must explain..if you'll pardon me for detaining you.$ I came here for a little supper.$ I often drop in.$ I told my chauffeur to call for me about.. 11: 30.$ I'm going to a ball that begins rather late.$ It's so lonely in the dining-room.$ There isn't a soul in there at this hour.$ I..I thought I'd rush up to see the Jacksons.$ Really?$ ─ Yes.$ We're such good friends.$ ─ Yes, so you said.$ I can't believe they'd go away without telling me.$ Well.. dear, dear..$ I.. beg your pardon and.. goodnight.$ Can I have the doorman ring for a taxi?$ ─ Thank you, but don't trouble.$ I'll.. wait in the hall.$ It's rather draughty there.But I dare say the time will pass.Somehow.$ ─ I dare say.$ Goodnight.$ ─ Goodnight.$ I hate to bother you again, but have you a cigarette?$ Oh yes, of course.$ And a light.$ ─ Oh yes, a light.$ Thank you.$ ─ Don't mention it.$ Goodnight.$ ─ Goodnight.$ Oh.. your handkerchief.$ Oh.. thank you again.$ ─ Not at all.$ Shall I ring for the elevator for you?$ ─ No thank you.$ But I want to apologize once more for..$ Please don't.. you've already apologized once.$ Oh well then, I want to apologize twice.$ I'm sure it's been an intrusion.$ ─ Not at all.$ Goodnight.$ ─ Goodnight.Allow me.$ I'm.. so sorry.$ ─ It's quite alright.$ Goodnight.$ ─ Goodnight.$ I beg your pardon.. but I'm back..$ Did.. did Madame forget something?$ Oh no.It's just that I heard voices as I was walking to the end of the hall.I recognized one of the voices.$ I knew that I'd be asked where I'd been.$ And as it's not the Jackson floor.. what could I say?$ And they're not there anyway.$ ─ Yes, and they're not there anyway.$ I'm really ashamed to mention it, but this town is notorious for gossip.$ I hope you don't misunderstand.$ ─ Not at all.$ You see how awkward it would be..$ ─ Awkward?$ Why of course..$ If I was seen coming out of a strange gentleman's room in a hotel..Why, that would be enough to.. well..$ Oh yes of course, it's quite clear now.$ I waited to hear the voices were going away, but they were coming near.$ So I was frightened and I..ventured to intrude again.$ You do see how it happened, don't you?$ ─ I understand perfectly, Madame.$ Would you mind closing the door, just until they've gone.$ Oh no, not at all.$ ─ Thank you.$ Won't you..?$ Just until they've gone.$ Oh, I'll only stay a second.$ I'm terribly ashamed to be imposing this way.$ It seems an impertinence for a stranger to keep dropping in here in such a fashion.$ Well, you've said that so often Madame, it might be rude to contradict you.$ I was afraid you were expecting someone.$ Not now.$ Well the ante-room room door wasn't even locked.It was unlatched.$ You don't want me to believe I hope, that you..left it open accidentally.$ No, I didn't leave it open accidentally.$ ─ Oh.. for someone in particular?$ For you, Madame Vago.$ Why didn't you say you knew who I was?$ ─ I was waiting for you to admit it.$ Of course..$ I don't know your name.$ Well, my friends call me" Jim".$ ─ Jim?$ Now we know each other.$ That is.. we start to know each other.$ Would you mind please, closing the window?$ That music makes me feel lonely, all of a sudden.$ Almost unhappy.$ I wonder if you know what I'm thinking at this moment.$ No.. but I'd love to.$ I was thinking that you'd never found a man who interested you.$ Otherwise, you wouldn't be so lonely and so unhappy tonight.$ And not quite so reckless.$ I'm not lonely or unhappy, nor reckless.$ If you'll pardon me saying so, you don't seem to value your reputation very highly.$ No, nor yourself either.$ ─ How dare you!$ Well you've forgotten to make the usual remark:" I thought you were a gentleman".$ No.. no, I didn't think you were.$ ─ Oh, you didn't?$ Do you happen to know who I am?$ ─ No, I don't want to know.$ Well, whether you want to know or not, I'll explain something about myself.$ No, please don't explain, it isn't necessary, and I couldn't stand it.$ You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.$ Why wouldn't I?$ ─ You wouldn't and I hate lies.$ But I only wanted to tell you something about my profession.$ Your profession?$ It's a matter of perfect indifference to me.$ I don't even want to speak of it.$ But why not?$ There are some things that cannot be spoken of.They are unmentionable.$ Do you mind telling me what you think I am?$ I'll ask you something.. you can answer in one word.$ But I want the truth.$ ─ You shall have it.$ Is it true that you are living here as the.." Guest" of the Marchesa?$ Oh.. yes, yes.Quite true.$ You share this apartment with her?$ Well then.. how can you?$ How can you do it?$ Oh..I see.$ I understand.$ Why did you put on all your lovely jewelery if you were coming to see a..?A gigolo.$ ─ Oh, I wasn't afraid.$ I'm surprised at you.$ Are you giving me a lesson in morality?$ ─ Oh no.$ No, in risks.$ Didn't you know that a gigolo could take all your jewelery away from you?$ Your lovely emeralds.$ Oh I wouldn't fight for them.They've never brought me any happiness.$ Still..Women have been killed for less.$ Oh you can't frighten me, I should get out.$ Yes I could!$ See how simple it is?$ I I lock the door and pocket the key.$ Then I pick up a knife or anything..$ I get hold of your hand, you can't even move.$ You..$ Why you're trembling.. you do realize what you've done.$ Are you scared?$ Please..I think I'll go now.$ You'll go when I tell you to, and not before.$ Please let go of me!$ Take your hands off me.$ Let me go.. get away.$ Please let me.. please let me go home.$ ─ You did everything to get in here.$ Well, you are in.Why can't you get out?$ Sit down.. sit down.$ Sit!$ You knew very well that I'd been going everywhere I could see you.$ The concerts, the opera, your street.$ You knew that I was in love with didn't you?$ Oh love.. there is no such thing.. for a man.$ Alright, put it the other way then.$ Say I.. wanted you?$ That's more like it.$ That's all men think of.$ It would be a lot better for women if they all knew it and accepted it.$ It would save tears.$ ─ Yes, but I only wanted you.$ One at a time, of course.$ Oh no, I wanted you, only you.$ I couldn't wait to get into my seat at the opera.I couldn't bear to leave it.$ When you first came in here tonight I hoped for a moment that you had..Felt something too, that perhaps you had caught the spark.$ A lot of men can't take their eyes off me at the opera.It doesn't mean anything.$ Oh they don't count.. you're a public favorite.$ It's their vanity, not love.$ Women come after me in droves but I don't flatter myself that..$ They come after you in droves?$ Women.. come.. after you.. in droves?$ Yes, women come after me in droves.$ If you let me tell you why.$ ─ I think you're shameless, and brazen.$ Just a minute, I will tell you.$ ─ No you won't, I won't listen.$ I don't want to hear any more" women come at you in droves".$ But I don't want to hear another word.Not another word, I won't listen to you.$ And while I was wondering how to meet you, you came in here and spoiled it all.$ Oh..I'm sorry.$ In another minute, I'm going to take you in my arms.$ Oh you're not!$ ─ And yet I could kill you for coming here.$ I want to hunt my women, not have them come after me.$ Oh Nella..$ Nella, why did you come here?$ Because I was lonely..$ something happened today.I made up my mind I wanted to live.. really live.$ I wanted to meet someone who..who uh..I thought of you.$ So, you came here for no better reason than curiosity, or to find a lover.$ And you thought you'd choose me, huh?$ A gigolo.. the Marchesa's gigolo.$ Oh, what a thing to do.$ Well... perhaps I wanted a gigolo.$ Oh, you did, did you?$ Alright then, young lady, you shan't leave here disappointed.$ Oh Jim.. how could you?$ Oh, so it's not a gigolo you want?$ ─ No, you know I don't.$ You were, you were horrible.$ The way you grabbed me..$ look.$ I'll be all marked up, I know I will.$ I'll be black and blue and I'll be singing Tosca on Thursday.. half naked.$ What a woman.. she's counting the spots.$ You like that better?$ And this one too.$ If you want me to be good, why don't you help?$ No, no..$ I'm afraid of you.$ I've changed my mind.$ I don't want to love a man, that is I do but..$ You'd get a hold on me and I shouldn't be able to break it.$ Why, I've only known you an hour.You see what's happened already?$ No, you're a man to stay away from.. now let me get up.$ Jim, I really don't want to get up but..$ I don't want a man who will make me think as he thinks and do as he does.$ And sit by while he lives.$ No, I want someone who'll be kind and sympathetic.$ A real friend.$ No lover was ever a real friend, that's impossible.$ A man who will share my life with me and have some common interests.$ Hmm.. what you want is a piano-player.No, no, no.$ I've got one now, and he's enough.$ Really, I'm serious..$ I'm in earnest.$ Love means.. it means everything to me.$ There is no inspiration in my life.$ That's what I miss.$ But I'm afraid of you.$ Loving you might become another kind of slavery.$ I'll think it over.$ Yes, I'd better.$ I'll let you know tomorrow.$ Oh no.$ It's tonight.. or never.$ There's the key to the door.$ It is three minutes to ten.$ I'll give three minutes to make up your mind.$ Three minutes to decide something as important as this?$ Well, I couldn't.$ In three minutes, get a taxi.$ I'll escort you down, and you'll never see me again.$ But I can't make up my mind in three minutes.. how impetuous you are!$ Please give me a little longer.$ If you're here three minutes from now, you will have to take the consequences.$ And what would the consequences be?$ You'd be held tight in my arms and you'd never get out.$ Perhaps you had better send for a taxi.$ ─ Certainly.$ Oh just a minute.. how quick you are?$ If I should stay, after all..of course I'm not going to.$ If you should, it would mean forever to us.Because I'd never let you go from me to another man.Think of that.$ You do like to bully a woman.$ You take an awful lot for granted don't you?$ Not unless I'm forced to.$ ─ And you're so possessive.$ I'm very possessive.$ And I adore you.$ ─ You don't.$ Shall I show you whether I do or not?$ ─ No.. no$ Then..$ I'll call a taxi.$ Before I go.. please kiss me.Just once.$ Sweetly, tenderly.. as if we really belonged to each other.$ Please call a taxi.$ ─ It's too late.$ Well.. she showed us today that she can sing!$ Yes, I'm glad.. but Professor..$ Remarkable!$ That's all I can say.. remarkable.. strange.$ Yes, I can't understand it at all.$ ─ Why not?$ Because she should have been all tired out.. today.$ Why should she?$ Oh Professor, I'm so glad you came.I want to ask you something very important.$ Did Madame wear her emerald necklace at the matinée today?$ I didn't notice.$ A crowd in the wings, a crowd in her dressing-room.I couldn't get near her.$ Seventeen curtain calls..$ I cannot find the emeralds!$ Nobody ever sang Tosca so..$ The audience rose at her..$ bravos and tears!$ She tore at their hearts.. strange.$ That's what it was.. strange.$ Something has happened.$ Something.. has taught her..how to cry.. and overnight.$ Yes, sir.Many ladies learn how to cry.. overnight.$ What do you mean?$ ─ Madame, she..I wonder if I should tell you.$ ─ Your mistress has no secrets from me.Come along now, what is it?$ ─ Well then..She was out.. all night.$ From the German Embassy?$ ─ She wasn't there.$ Where was she, then?$ ─ I don't know.$ But she came home at six this morning.$ She slept the whole day.$ She got up just before the performance.$ And Professor..She was.. singing.. in the bathtub.$ I never heard her do it before.$ ─ Stop there.$ I don't like that" singing in the bath" business.$ And that's all you know?$ ─ And I know that I can't find the necklace.$ Well my girl..I wouldn't hire you as a detective.No I would not.$ I'll see once more in the safe.$ Good evening Madame.$ Ah.. here you are.. at last!$ Seventeen curtain calls.$ I'm proud of you.$ Aren't you happy?$ ─ Of course I'm happy.$ It was a wonderful afternoon.$ You don't seem at all excited.$ When you sang like a lark.. no-one ever sang Tosca like that before.$ Never!$ Never!$ Really?$ ─ Never.$ Madame.. may I speak?$ Of course Conrad.$ Your singing today, pleased me very much.$ Conrad!$ You.. you were at the opera this afternoon?$ Oh surely you didn't listen to me through the whole of Tosca?$ Not all through?$ ─ I did Madame.$ I was wandering in, back of the scene..When I heard Madame's voice..Ring out as I have never heard it.$ I sat down on a piece of scenery, to listen.$ And Madame may not believe me..But at the end of the act, I went to the front and bought a seat in the balcony.$ I never believed that Madame had the divine spark.$ I..I'm afraid I forgot myself.$ I stood up and shouted with the crowd.$ Conrad!$ I'd rather hear that from you, than have the praise of all the Kings of Europe.$ Madame, I will never miss another opera.. in which you sing.$ May I be permitted to kiss the hand of a great artist?$ Madame.$ Now the world can come to an end.$ It already has Rudig.$ I received this this afternoon, after the performance.$ Fletcher.. the impresario Fletcher.. he's in Budapest.$ He was at the opera.$ A contract!..$ Well, you have only to

Madame.$ Where are your emeralds?$ Oh, somewhere about.$ None of your business anyway.$ Look at me.. you were out all night.. where were you?$ Is it possible?$ Your emeralds.. they were stolen by that gigolo.$ How dare you!$ He didn't steal them.$ I.. gave them to him.$ ─ You gave them to him?$ My dear child, how foolish to give a whole necklace of emeralds..When the one on your finger would have done just as well.$ You don't understand.$ Oh, I don't want to think about it.$ These gigolos.. how do they do it?$ They write songs about them.$ What's this man's name?$ ─ I forgot to ask.$ Oh yes.. it's" Jim".$ It's an odd name..$ it's a beautiful name.$ He isn't like anybody else.. he's a gentleman$ And he.. isn't.. a gentleman.$ He's a gentleman when he takes your hand and a gigolo when he

New York.$ - Been here long?$ - Four years.$ - Four years.What made you come?$ - Work.$ - What kind of work do you do?$ - I'm a chorus girl.$ A chorus girl?$ Oh, gee.$ - You came over with a show, huh?$ - Yeah, The Pink Lady.$ - When it ended, The Bing Boys.$ - That must be interesting.$ - Yeah, when you can get it.$ - Been out long?$ - I certainly have.$ - What a rotten break.$ - And that accounts for...$ - Yeah, that accounts for this rotten place.$ I admit the refrigerator is old-fashioned.$ - Please, I didn't mean to be critical.$ - Oh, I know the place isn't the Ritz but...$ Oh, you don't wanna be bothered with a hard-luck tale.$ - Tell me.$ - Well, jobs are hard to find and rents are high, that's all.$ - Behind with it?$ - Gee.Let's talk about something cheerful.$ - How much is it?$ Well, if you must know, it's just under five pounds.$ But I'll get a job soon.$ Well, you see, it isn't only rent.$ Price of everything has gone up so.$ Why, this afternoon I was in Leicester Square...$ You know that Stag and Medals.$ Anyway, there's the cutest little pink dress in the window perfectly plain and simple.$ - What do you think they want for it?$ - What?$ Three guineas.$ Myra, I don't want you to take offense in anything I say but, well, heck, you see, I got more money than I want as a soldier and, well, couldn't I square things up for you?$ You know, with the rent and maybe get you that pink dress.$ Gee, that's sweet of you.$ I wouldn't think of it.$ I don't see why not.$ Who's to know?$ Oh, it's the principle of the thing.$ What's the difference?$ Some of us are lucky, some of us aren't.$ Just at this very minute you aren't.$ Please.$ Go on.$ Take it.$ It would make me so happy.$ Just do it as a favor to me.$ As a favor to you?$ I don't know what to say, but...$ -

You want another cigarette?$ - Let's smoke these.$ All right.$ - Do you like music?$ - Why, yeah.$ I do.$ This is from The Bing Boys.$ So you're going down to see your mother tomorrow.$ I'm glad.$ It's good for a soldier to get out of this town as quick as he can.$ - What's the matter with it?$ - It isn't healthy.$ Only two things for a soldier to do when he's a stranger like you.$ That's get drunk and get mixed up with the wrong kind of women.$ That's a bug.$ I know the troops go wild when they get in the big city.But that's because they got no friends.$ - But you see, I'm lucky.$ - Are you?$ Why?$ - Well, I met up with you.$ - That's lucky, isn't it?$ - A few seconds ago, I was bawling you out.$ - I forgot that.$ I ought to have had more sense.$ I should have known a decent girl when I saw one.$ You've never been around with girls much, have you?$ Not much?$ Why?$ - When do you go back to the trenches?$ - I got 14 days.$ Say.$ Say, have you got a man or somebody out at the front that you're interested in?$ - You mean, somebody I knit socks for?$ - Well, that kind of thing, yeah.$ - No.$ - I was thinking...$ I was thinking it would be swell if you could work up a little interest in me.$ Guess I could.$ Even to the sock-knitting stage?$ Well, I never tried knitting.$ You know, I might at that.$ Gee, Myra, I like you a lot.$ Do you?$ - Who's there?$ - It's me, dear.$ Mrs. Hobley.$ Well?$ I thought perhaps you would like to know they're sounding the all clear in the streets.$ Thanks.$ I think I'll be going to bed now, dear.$ All right.$ Did you want to see me about anything, dearie?$ Not now, I'll see you in the morning.$ All right.$ Good night.$ - Good night.$ - Sleep well.$ - She is a nice soul, that Mrs. Hobley.$ - Yeah.$ She's cute, isn't she?$ - Looks like the raid's over, soldier.$ - That mean you want me to buzz off?$ - It's getting kind of late.$ - All right, I'll go.$ But, say, listen, Myra.$ I've had an idea.$ How would it be if you were to come down with me tomorrow?$ - What do you mean?$ - Well, change will do you good.$ You mean, come down to your family's?$ I know you'd like them.$ Come on, we'd have fun.$ - How old are you, Roy?$ - Nineteen, why?$ - That's not very old, is it?$ - I don't see what that's got to do with it.$ - What do you say, will you come?$ - No.$ - Oh, Myra, why not?- Can't.$ I gotta look for a job tomorrow.$ Oh, gee.$ Isn't that tough?$ I tell you what.$ I'll come and see you before I go in the morning.$ - I won't be up.$ - Well, I'll wait until you get up.$ - Goodbye.$ - Goodbye.$ - Good night, Myra.$ - Good night, Roy.$ Here!$ Oh, I'm sorry.$ Give me a penny, mister.$ Oh, give me a penny, mister.$ Thank you.$ Oh, good morning, Mrs. Hobley.$ Good morning.$ What can I do for you?$ - Is Miss Deauville in?$ - Not in here.$ You hop it.$ You're the young fellow who's with her last night, aren't you?$ - No, I'm afraid she isn't back yet.$ - She's out shopping or something?$ - Shopping is right.$ - Perhaps I can go on up and wait.$ Oh, it's nothing to do with me, you'll find the door open.$ Hello.$ I didn't mean to intrude.$ Is Myra at home?$ - Well, no.$ But she'll be here any a minute.$ - Well, I won't disturb you then.$ You're not disturbing me.$ I just came in myself.$ - Oh, you...You've just come in?$ - Yes, I...$ Was Myra expecting you?$ Yes, I told her I'd pop along.$ You see, I live in the next house.$ But I'll be toddling back now.$ But that roof doesn't look like a very good place to do much toddling.$ Oh, we come and go on it all the time.$ If you wanna wait for Myra, why don't you come in?$ - You mind?$ - Not at all.$ Well, look the other way then.$ Sure.$ It's all right, you can look now.$ Oh, what lovely flowers.$ - Where did these come from?$ - Oh, I brought those.$ You did?$ Well, aren't they ducky.$ - I sense you're a new friend of Myra's.$ - Oh, yeah, we're friends.$ - Just a wartime acquaintance?$ - That's it.$ - You a friend of Myra's too?$ - Well, yes, why we're the best.$ - She and I used to work together.$ - You were in The Pink Lady too.$ No, no.$ But we've been intimate for ever so long.$ Strange she hasn't mentioned you.$ She has so few friends.$ Well, to tell you the truth, we only just met.$ - This morning?$ - No, last night.$ You know, I hate to think of her going through all this air raids, bum food and...$ I know.$ And she's such a little thing.$ She doesn't seem to wanna talk about her affairs.$ - How does she get along?$ - It's a constant struggle.$ And she's so lonely.$ Do you know that she hasn't got a single soul that she can count on for help?$ - And she does need it.$ - You can tell that.$ Of course, I'm devoted to her.$ But then, I'm poverty-stricken myself.$ You see my...$ My dear husband is no more.$ - I'm sorry.$ - He was a soldier.$ Young, handsome, full of hope.$ Just like yourself.$ He got his in the crater at Ypres.$ Poor fellow.$ But how about Mrs. Hobley?$ She seems friendly.$ Yeah, she seems friendly, all right.$ But Mrs. Hobley's a proper whited sepulcher, I'll give you my word.$ What's she gonna do now?$ Myra.$ She doesn't seem to be crazy about going back on-stage.$ I should hope not.$ The theater's no place for a nice girl like her.$ Guess it isn't a very pleasant atmosphere.$ - Unless...$ - Unless what?$ Well, you know, it's always been my hope you might almost call it my dream that someday, some nice young man would come along and appreciate Myra.$ You know, marry her.$ Give her a home.$ Protect her.$ Guess there hasn't been much chance of that here.$ You've got it.$ And that's just the danger that she is face to face with at this very moment.$ How do you mean danger?$ Bad influences.$ You have no idea what London is like in wartime.$ Why, the immorality here is ghastly.$ I guess Myra can take care of herself on that.$ Then how can she, when she's neglected and helpless?$ And stony broke and face to face with starvation.$ Is she broke?$ Her condition is senseless.$ - Hello, dear.$ - Hello.$ I didn't know anybody was here.$ I just popped over and found mister...$ Your friend here.$ - We've been having quite a jolly little chat.$ - Yes, very.$ Well, I'll I'll leave you two now and be toddling.$ - Pleased to have met you.$ - Bye.$ - Cheerio, Canada.$ - Goodbye.$ - She been talking long?$ - Only a few minutes.$ I was afraid of missing you if it was any later.$ My train leaves at a quarter to.$ I brought you some flowers, Myra.$ Oh, they're lovely.$ But you shouldn't have.$ Bet they cleaned you out for those.$ Actually, I've got something else.$ I went into that shop, Stag and Medals.$ You got that pink dress?$ Yeah, shall I open it?$ No, I don't want it.$ I don't want you to give me anything.$ Myra, you don't have to pretend with me.$ I know you're hard up.$ - Gee, that girl was just telling me...$ - She doesn't know anything about it.$ She doesn't know about my private income.$ You've got a private income?$ - Certainly.$ - Where does it come from?$ - From my folks back home.$ - They're rich?$ - Sure.$ - How much do they send you?$ A couple of postage stamps so you can write home.$ Don't you insult my family.$ They can take care of their daughter wherever she is.$ - I don't mean to be nasty but if they send you money, why do you live in this place?$ - It isn't a million dollars a year.$ - I know how much it is, Myra.$ It isn't a darn cent.$ You've just been lying to me to keep me from helping.$ - What business is it of yours?$ I want to know.$ Who gave you the right to question me about my affairs?$ - I gave myself the right.$ - And how did you manage to do that?$ - By loving you, that's how.$ Roy silly you can't do that.$ - Oh, can't I.$ - No, I say you can't, it isn't possible.$ - Why isn't it possible?$ - Why can't I love you?$ - It's wrong it's all wrong.$ - Why wrong?$ - It doesn't fit in, you loving me.$ - My dear I wouldn't care if you were in a thousand shows of the circus.$ I love you.$ Yeah.$ Wait until you get back, then see how much you think about me.$ - Are you thinking about your family?$ Well, I mean...I mean is it just because I'm a common private?$ Yes, Roy.$ That's one of the things I'm thinking about.$ Why, I'd be ashamed even to introduce you to my people if they were living, which they aren't, thank God.$ And do you wanna know why I'd be ashamed?$ Because my mother and father were a couple of drunken sots.$ And they lived in East St. Louis, an exclusive suburb.$ That's where I came from.$ I ran away and went on the stage because I was scared to stay in my own home.$ I was scared that they would kill me when they were liquored.$ That's how much aristocracy I am.$ And you talk about me being lonely.$ Me with everything I've got.$ That's it, Roy.$ - You've got enough in your own life.$ - Yes, but what have you got, Myra?$ What have you...?$ No, I can take care of myself.$ Myra you said there was nobody else.$ - There isn't.$ - Did there used to be?$ - I never loved anyone.$ Then I'm not gonna stand here and argue anymore about it.$ Don't hold your head like that.$ Look at me.$ Oh, Roy.$ Don't say anything more, sweetheart.$ I know how it is.$ You just didn't want me to get into this.$ You thought I might regret it someday.$ Well, that's all right.$ I'm not going to regret this ever.$ Ever.$ I guess I know who it is I love.$ Roy.$ - You'll miss your train.$ - Yeah, I I guess I better had be going now.$ But listen, darling.$ I'm coming back for you.$ - What do you mean?$ - I'm coming back to see you.$ I'll be back just as soon as I can get away.$ I...$ Hello, ducky.$ Come on in.$ What have you been saying to him?$ I've been telling him nothing that wasn't good for him to hear.$ I've been singing your blooming praises, all right.$ I was hoping he'd come and go away.$ Not him.$ He waited to hear all the information I had to give him about you.$ Yeah, and what was that?$ That you was a poor, lonely, little girl.$ Half-starved and hungry for love.$ The only thing on God's Earth, I said, that can save her is a husband.$ - A husband?$ - Yes.$ And he's willing to step up and do his duty, by king and country.$ And what's more, I'm prepared to be your bridesmaid and help you blush.$ Did he say that he'd marry me?$ Well, not quite but he was coming to it when you burst in and interrupted.$ - He's yours, I tell you.$ - What if I don't want him?$ Well, what if you don't?$ What's the harm?$ All you have to do is go through with the ceremony collect his separation allowance, and live in luxury.$ Then there's your insurance, if he gets knocked off in action.$ I don't want his insurance and I'm not gonna steal his pay.$ Who says it's stealing?$ Marriage is legal, ain't it?$ Why, it's early.$ Look at Agnes Ellen.$ She's got four husbands in the army.$ Two Australians, one Yorkshire man, and her own husband.$ She's collecting separation allowances from all of them.$ And what's more, she's making them all happy.$ Of course, there is the risk that two or three of her husbands might get leave at the same time.$ But that shouldn't bother you with only one on your hands.$ Look here, I put you in the way of a good thing.$ It's a stinking thing, Kitty.$ What's stinking about it, I'd like to know?$ He loves you, don't he?$ Of course, he does.$ Look at the flowers he's brought you.$ He don't even know me.$ And he never will, if I have to jump in the river to keep him from finding out.$ You've bloody well gone queer in your head, haven't you?$ Maybe.$ Now, what do you think of this port, Roy?$ - Pretty good, Roy?$ - Seems fine to me.$ Seems fine to me.$ - But I don't know very much about wines.$ - That's a pity.$ They tell me some people in your country are trying to do away with wine altogether.$ Curious idea.$ Oh, that's all nonsense, darling.$ It's just a lot of talk.$ Nothing will come of it.$ You mustn't believe all you see in the papers.$ We're not as bad as all that.$ Of course, I don't know America very well.$ I was only in the place two or three weeks, but they...$ They seemed to be sane and responsible sort of people.$ No, I don't want any of that.$ Here, Hives.$ Pass the port, Jenny.$ - Have some more, Roy.$ - No more for me, thanks.$ No, thank you.$ Does it feel good to be home, darling?$ - Swell.$ - By the way when you were in the Cambridge sector, did you come across an old friend of mine?$ - Who was that, sir?$ - Old Plumsteed.$ - Charlie Plumsteed.$ - Was he a private?$ No, he was a brigadier.$ No, sir, no, I don't run across many of those.$ No, I don't suppose you do, but you may have met his son.$ Did you ever meet old Plumsteed's son?$ You know, young Plumsteed.$ - He's a second lieutenant, isn't he?$ - Yes, I think he is.$ I remember coming across him at the base on the way home.$ Roy, don't be cynical.$ He's not cynical.$ Somebody has to be at the base.$ You're very silent, Mary.$ That's because I have nothing to say.$ I'm just enjoying myself, trying to realize Roy is back home.$ Yes, nice having him, isn't it?$ You must come again soon.$ I hope, though, I haven't got that silly.$ You can't come until they let you.$ Listen, now I can tell you what I want to tell you.$ - It's about a girl.$ - About a what?$ Well, about a girl.$ I don't know what he's talking about.$ A girl, darling, you know, a girl.$ A girl.$ Yeah, yeah, yes, I know, a girl is.$ Well, what about it, boy?$ - Tell me about her, Roy.$ - Well, there isn't much to tell, Mother.$ It all sounds rather silly.$ You see, I've only known her a few hours.$ I met her on my way through.$ Come on, Jenny, don't go to sleep with that port, pass it.$ - It's under your nose, darling.$ - What?$ Your nose.$ See, things do happen pretty quickly now.$ I mean, they have to.$ You know, with the war on, you never know where you're gonna be next.$ Well, the fact is I do like her.$ Terribly.$ - What's her name?$ - Myra.$ - Myra what?$ - Myra Deauville.$ That's not her real name, of course.$ She's on the stage.$ - Who introduced you to her?$ - Nobody.$ We met by accident during an air raid.$ She a well-known actress?$ Well, no, but she's awfully pretty.$ Actually, she is only in the chorus.$ She's had it pretty tough lately, you know.$ - Couldn't get a job in one thing or another.$ - What a shame.$ Well, what I wanted to know I mean, what I wanted to ask is...$ - What did you want to ask, Roy?$ - I wondered if you'd hate very much if we couldn't have her down here for a while.$ - Would you like that?$ - It would be grand.$ I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't think you'd like her.$ I know she's a chorus girl, but she's different.$ - I'm sure I shall like her.$ - That means I can ask her?$ As far as I'm concerned, it does.$ - Do you mind, Fred?$ - Do I mind what?$ If we ask this girl down here for a day or two?$ I haven't heard a word you've been talking about.$ - Oh, Fred.- You mumble so.$ Well, what is it?$ I'll tell him, Mother.$ -

Fortune.$ - Thanks.$ Well done, Fred, I didn't know you were so active.$ Jan, you need a baseball field, not a tennis court.$ I'll take you on afterwards.$ We'll see how good you are.$ Come on, come on, come on.$ I'm waiting to serve.$ Sorry.$ Janet used to be quite good.$ The child's out of practice.$ -

each one brought me nearer to Dan, to get him back.$ Now we're going to a foreign country to live.$ I'm gonna change my name.$ Paid a murderous price, Steve.$ But I got Dan.$ - Jenny, are you through?$ - Yup.$ No more sneaking around trying to get glimpses of him.$ Looking at him over fences and through windows.$ I got him.$ All of him.$ Janet, I know it's a hard thing to bear, the boy has meant so much to us.$ There's no question as to her claim.$ Must you take him now?$ I'm sorry, Mrs. Reynolds, yes.$ Go to your mother, Dan.$ Mama, why are you crying?$ Now listen, Dan.$ You're a great big man now.$ And well, you're going away for a while.$ - Military school?$ Not right now.$ You're going on a fine trip on a big steamboat.$ Way across the ocean.$ You'll have all kinds of fun.$ It'll be great.$ Are you and Mama going with me?$ You're going with your mother.$ Your real mother.$ Dan.$ Don't you remember me at all?$ You aren't my mother.$ Mama, I don't know that lady and I'm not going with her.$ Please don't let her take me away.$ - I wanna stay here with you and Papa.$ I'm ashamed of you.$ That's no way for a great big man to act.$ I won't go with her.$ I don't know her and I don't like her.$ I wanna stay here.$ Never mind.$ I'll never bother you again.$ Can I?$ Well, Jenny.Now what?$ When I said I was through, I guess I was just kidding myself.$ Steve, he's wonderful.$ Born in a cellar under a fish market, but a gentleman, Amah.$ A real man.$ Nothing beyond his reach.$ District attorney governor even president.$ Confucius says:$ " Fortunate is the mother of a man-child."$ - Will you see Mr. Weaver?$ - Yeah.$ Lock this up, Amah.$ - Hi, Jenny.$ - How are you, George?$ Never better.$ One hundred G's.$ - Everything is represented?$ - Tallied to a bottle.$ Five thousand cases at 2o a case.$ One hundred G's.$ - Have any trouble?$ - I never do with your stuff.$ - Guess I'm lucky.$ - No just acquainted with the right boys and girls.$ Say, by the way, that Tom Ford's a honey.$ He made everything awful easy.$ Take it from me, this will be the rightest town in America after we elect him DA.$ Suppose you boys will stick together.$ Anyone in our crowd doesn't vote at least three times for him is a traitor.$ - You think Reynolds hasn't got a chance?$ - No, not a smell.$ He'll get one vote.$ His own.$ - How was it, Georgie?$ - Just a pushover.$ I'll give you a check.$ No hurry.No hurry at all.$ Tom Ford helped a little, didn't he?$ All $ 5ooo worth, I should say.$ It'll pay for the party he's giving tonight.$ - Stag?- Mm-hm.$ For about a dozen of his staunchest admirers.$ I think I'm guest of honor.$ Guest of what?$ I knew Tom helped out on the deal because he said he was coming up to see you this afternoon.$ - Here are his cigars.$ What a cute little district attorney old Tom is going to make.$ I wonder if this funny old world ever saw anything so topsy-turvy.$ Jenny Sandoval's son running against Jenny Sandoval's pet politician.$ The gods must all be out to lunch.$ Why shouldn't Dan run for district attorney or anything else?$ There's only one hurdle that can throw him.$ Me.So he's safe.$ Mr. Ford.$ Tell him to come right in.$ Well, well, well, if isn't my old pals, Jenny and Steve.$ - Hello, Tom.$ - How are you?$ How did that little matter progress this afternoon?$ - Smooth as a river of oil.$ - I don't know what we'd do without you.$ If I've been valuable with my limited opportunities imagine what I'm gonna be after I get in.$ Why, you'll be able to use the city hall for a kennel.$ I know that, Tom.Isn't that a box of your favorite cigars?$ Corona coronas.$ What a bouquet.$ But don't open that till you get home.$ That bouquet might drop out and bite you.$ Jenny, I know you'll excuse me if I have to rush along.$ Gotta address the Women's Better Government League at 5: oo.$ The Women's Better Government League?$ You're sensational.$ I've gotta be.$ Reynolds has been accusing me of every crime in the book.$ I gotta

he stole so much as an apple, I'll broadcast it.$ If he didn't, I'll invent something.Dig him up back to the cradle.$ He'll learn a lesson to leave old Tom Ford alone.$ So the mud is gonna fly, huh?$ You bet.$ Well, so long, Steve.$ So long, Jenny.$ See you tonight, Tom.$ - I almost forgot, my party.$ Jenny, will you dig me up about a dozen young debutants to liven up the gathering tonight?$ Well, you see, Tom, I haven't been in contact with the 4oo for a long time.$ But you call up Fremont 7495 and mention my name.$ You're a pal, Jenny.$ A real pal.$ You know, there's one thing that always touches old Tom Ford right here.$ And that's loyalty and friendship.$ - Well, so long.$ Good night, Tom.$ Well there goes our next district attorney.$ Don't go to that party.$ Oh, why not?$ I got a silly hunch that you might not like it.$ - Come on, have dinner with me.$ - All right, Jenny, it's a pleasure.$ Still get my coffee from Goldberg, Bowen.$ And it's still delicious.$ Oh, by the way,

Georgie, dear, you're talking to a lady who's quit.$ I was always a hunch player and I had a hunch we were gonna get awful unlucky.$ That's why I quit after election.$ - We'll take care of it

tell me that Jenny Sandoval can't reach that squirt?$ Georgie, I'm only interested in reaching Paris, which is in France.$ I'm going out to buy Amah and me a one-way ticket that long.$ I've retired, I'm through.$ It's goodbye merchandise, San Francisco, everything.$ Make yourselves at home, boys.Toodle-loo.$ Looks like we're out on a limb.$ - Now what?$ - That stuff isn't lost, it's in a warehouse.$ A smart guy by the name of Reynolds is holding the key.$ Well, it's a cinch Jenny isn't gonna help any.$ She's probably got her own reasons.$ That's not gonna stop me from trying, come on.$ Now, Mr. Reynolds, I realize we've been at cross-purposes.$ I'd have come to see you sooner, but you were busy getting settled in your new offices, so I waited until I could see you privately.$ - What do you want me to do, Mr. Dutton?$ - Well, 15 of my boys are in jail.$ And 5ooo cases of excellent liquor are in our warehouse.$ And I'm prepared to make a most generous gesture to get them out, Mr. Reynolds.$ Do you smoke cigars?$ - No, no, thanks.$ - Oh, I think you'll like these.$ There's $ 1 o, ooo in United States currency in this box, Mr. Dutton.$ Well, the cigar store man must have wrapped up my change by mistake.$ - And you still want me to keep this?$ All right.Fine.$ - Did you get all that, Pat?$ Sure.$ Here's Exhibit A.$ Well, you've copped my jack, but I've still got an ace.$ You're gonna need it when I get you and Jenny Sandoval on the witness stand.$ I don't think she'll testify, besides she's not my partner.$ Maybe not.$ But it happens that I have photostatic copies of several large checks she made payable to you.$ The jury might be interested in the connection between you and the most notorious woman in town.$ You'd better go slow you're putting yourself on the spot, my boy.$ I'll risk it.$ Money, won't touch you, eh?$ But you can be stopped.$ Make out a warrant for Steve Dutton's arrest:Bribery.That'll do to start with.$ You'll only be sorry once and that'll be all your life.$ Fifty thousand dollars' bail for a little thing like bribery.$ Well, all bail is going up.$ Dan Reynolds is gonna make a millionaire out of me.$ You get it while you can, he won't be in there very long.$ - Gotta go to him.You gotta talk.$ - I won't do it.$ Are you gonna let him push me into the penitentiary?$ Don't you realize he's got me tied hand and foot.$ I can get 1 o years, but you can save me with a word.$ I won't do it.$ I won't do it.$ We've been partners for 2o years.Sharing each others dough.$ The first time I get in a jam, you step away.$ You expect me to dynamite my son's career?$ - One little whisper in his ear and he'll stop.$ - Not a chance.$ So your mind's made up, eh?$ My mind has been made up since I left him in Oakland.$ Do you think it's been easy for me to give up my son?$ Never to see him, never to be with him?$ But I stood it, didn't I?$ Because I knew just being near him was a menace.$ I was the one thing that could ruin him.$ But I didn't do it, did I?$ Now that he's become somebody, you expect all my suffering to go for nothing?$ - Well, if you don't tell him, I'm going to.$ - No, you're not.$ District attorney's office.$ Let me speak to Mr. Reynolds.$ This is Steve Dutton.$ Don't, Steve, stop it!$ Stop it!$ Tell him I'm coming down there, I got a very important statement.$ Just tell him what I said.$ I don't care what he's doing, he'll see me.$ Steve.$ Steve, you can't do it.$ - Get out of my way.$ - I won't let you do it.I won't...$ Stop that woman.Stop her!$ Stop her!$ Bring her back here.$ Keep her back there, boys.$ She did it.$ She's your...$ Your...$ The state's witnesses have never been shaken despite the efforts of the learned counsel for the defense.$ We have the affidavit from the telephone company as to the exact time of Mr. Dutton's call to my office.$ As to the import of that call you have already heard my testimony and testimony of my secretary.$ Let me remind you again, that the telephone call came from the defendant's apartment.$ We have proven that she was with Dutton when he called my office and must have heard his promise to bring some vital information to me.$ William Mullins, the taxi driver, testified that he delivered the defendant in front of my office not over two minutes before the crime was committed.$ Officers Scanlan and Verger have testified that they arrested the defendant not over 5o feet from the scene of the crime with the smoking revolver still in her hand.$ I have told you how Steve Dutton died in the doorway of my office and attempted to identify her.$ The evidence of guilt, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is more than complete.$ Now let's look into the motive.$ This will have to be done by the simplest deduction because the defendant has consistently refused to take the stand on her behalf.$ This motive is childishly simple.$ The defendant and Steve Dutton had been partners for years controlling together commercialized vice on which they mutually fattened.$ In the roots of every slimy and degraded enterprise which has for so long disgraced the fair name of our city we have found Steve Dutton and Jenny Sandoval.$ Going back over their past is like digging up carrion a stench in the nostrils of society.$ The connection between these two was shown years ago in another murder.$ I refer to the mysterious and unsolved killing of Ed Harris, the gambler, in 19o9.$ They were the only ones present in the room of death yet they stood no trial.$ Why?$ Because Dutton's power even then, clogged the wheels of justice.$ Crime flourishes in the dark.$ In the shadow of Steve Dutton and Jenny Sandoval.$ But retribution must come at last.$ By my order, Dutton was finally arrested on a felony charge, his trial set.$ The law was finally to collect its debt.$ The penitentiary was inevitable.$ Motive?$ Here is your motive, ladies and gentlemen of the jury:$ Panic-stricken, he phoned me said he was on his way to my office with information.$ Phoned from this woman's apartment.$ The tenderloin never comes bearing gifts to the prosecutor.$ The cowardly criminal comes to barter and to trade.$ To trade the liberty of his associate for his own.$ To turn state's evidence.$ What was the information so vital to the defendant that she must seal Steve Dutton's lips in death?$ Ladies and gentlemen, give your imagination full scope.$ Jenny Sandoval, look at her.$ Born in the slums raised on the Barbary Coast in her father's notorious dive.$ We lose her only for a moment, during the great fire.$ Then we pick up traces of her in the lowest cellars of Chinatown.$ From this point on, her trail is well-blazed:$ Organized vice gambling halls, casinos, implication in a murder.$ And after the advent of Prohibition, control of the bootlegging in this city.$ Search as we will we can find no redeeming trait in this defendant's life.$ No redeeming feature in her character.$ Her progress in crime has been logical.$ Culminating as it had to culminate, here in a court of justice.$ Charged with deliberate, cold-blooded, premeditated murder.$ It is the judgment and sentence of this court, Jenny Sandoval that for the crime of which you have been convicted, murder of the first degree that you be delivered by the sheriff of San Francisco County to the warden of the state prison of the state of California at San Quentin.$ To be by him executed and put to death on Friday, the 27th day of January, 1933.Between the hours of 1 o a. m.And 4 p.$ And may God have mercy on your soul.$ How much time we got?$ Oh, about an hour.$ Amah.$ Amah.$ Amah, I'm yellow.$ I'm a coward.$ I can't face it.$ Oh, Amah.$ Amah, save me.$ Save me.$ The sage says:$ " Death, being universal, must be a blessing."$ He said there was no redeeming trait in my life.$ No redeeming feature in my character.$ He was right.$ I'm not even brave.$ The cellars of Chinatown.$ Yeah, I was there.$ So was he.$ It was there I gave him life.$ He gives me death.$ Steve said," The gods must all be out to lunch."$ The gods see everything.$ Everything in this world must balance.$ The son to whom you gave life, gives you death great suffering.$ He, too, must suffer.$ The agony of continuing to live and learn that he has hanged his own mother.$ Give me your permission to tell him.$ If he knew, he might be able to help you.$ This is the only chance to save your life and you refuse to take it.$ You choose death.$ Amah, Amah, tell him.$ Tell him, quick.$ No, I'll do it.$ I'll wait.$ I'm glad you came, Mr. Reynolds.$ I wanted to talk to you.$ I hoped you would, that's why I came.$ I can't get this case off my mind.I can't forget you.$ Can't you?$ Why did you refuse to take the stand?$ Why didn't you ever say one word in your own behalf?$ Why didn't you give a reason for killing Dutton?$ Believe me, Miss Sandoval, I'm trying to help you.$ We might be able to reach the governor.Get a stay of execution.$ You seem anxious to undo my conviction.You worked so hard to get it.$ I don't know what it is.$ I just feel there's something wrong.$ In court I was sure.$ Now I'm not.$ Help me.$ What was so vital in your life that you had to kill to conceal it?$ - Nothing.$ - You must be shielding somebody.$ Exaggerated loyalty.$ There's no debt that big in the world.$ Who is it?$ You have no parents?$ No brothers or sisters?$ No child?$ Nobody near or dear to you?$ Well, if you won't let me help you...$ Time's up, Mr. Reynolds.$ Amah.$ Amah!$ You didn't tell him.$ And you never will.$ Amah, you've been my only friend.$ You've been loyal and true and devoted all these years.$ There's just one more favor I must ask.$ Look in the drawer of my desk you'll find Dan's scrapbook.$ All Dan's pictures.$ Burn it.$ Don't let him trace me.$ Promise you'll do it?$ I promise.$

It's hard to believe that.$ - Yes, for a policeman, I suppose it is.$ But I tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world, all its own.$ Yes, well, what would these reminders be, for instance?$ Anything.$ The sight of the sea, the full moon.$ Anything.$ The poor devil, sane at all other times, is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad.$ Very interesting.$ Particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy.$ Are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this?$ -

Well...$ - I'm waiting, Doctor.$ Professor Wells is a student of cannibalism.$ He's written a book about it.$ Why didn't you tell us this before?$ It's as good as a conviction.$ I hardly think so.$ I'm very fond of Dr. Wells.$ He couldn't possibly do a thing of this sort.$ - May I talk to him?- Why, certainly.$ Certainly.$ Come this way, gentlemen.$ What a very strange, uncanny place you have here, Doctor.$ What are all these doors?$ They are the laboratories of my faculty.$ Dr. Wells, Dr. Duke, Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines.$ And all those men are here at this hour of the night?$ They seldom leave.$ They live for their work.$ After all, this is a research institute.$ I should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen.$ Of course.$ I'm sorry to disturb you, Professor Wells, but I would like to introduce some friends of mine.$ - May we come in?$ - Of course, of course, gentlemen.$ Come in.$ Come closer.$ - This is Mr. Stevens.Mr. O'Halloran.$ - Professor, how do you do?$ How do you do?$ That's interesting, isn't it?$ If this experiment is successful, we will be a little nearer the secret of life.$ What is that?$ That's a heart.$ I've kept it alive for three years by electrolysis.$ Electrolysis?$ Professor Wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes.$ - You flatter me, Doctor.$ - Oh, no, no.$ I understand, Professor, that you live just for your work,$ - that you seldom leave the institute.$ - Not necessarily.$ I played truant a short while ago.$ I was down by the waterfront for a breath of air.$ - What time was that?$ - You're not feeling well?$ - Your arm is troubling you?$ - Yes, it's very annoying.$ Well, you're foolish to sit there in discomfort.$ - lf you gentlemen don't mind, I...$ - Why, of course not, of course not.$ I put it on just as I heard you coming.$ An empty sleeve is revolting to most people.$ Well, I think we've taken up enough of Professor Wells' time.$ - Oh, not at all, Mr. Stevens.$ - Thank you, Professor.$ Well, gentlemen, shall we be going?$ There are many other interesting things to see.$ Yes, let's be going.$ - Good evening.$ - Good night.$ Thank you for calling.$ You know, this is a tough case.$ There isn't much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand.$ - Oh, I agree with you.$ - Well, that lets him out of the picture.$ - Whose room is that?$ - Professor Haines'.$ Is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation?$ Well, of course, if you're just looking for someone to hang suspicion on, there's not a man on my faculty that wouldn't come under that heading.$ Then, you do know something about this man Haines.$ - No, not exactly, except...$ - Except what?$ - Well...$ - Come on, come on.$ Well, what is it?$ Dr. Haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off Tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the Killary Foundation.$ Now what's that got to do with it?$ - You say they were shipwrecked?$ - Yes, they were adrift for 24 days.$ Their supplies were exhausted.$ When they were picked up, Haines and one other were delirious.$ The third had vanished.$ There was no explanation at the time.$ Haines later claimed the man had died, and he had thrown the body overboard.$ - I should like to meet him.$ - Surely.$ But I am sure that he's not the guilty party.$ The killer is a maniac, and Dr. Haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world.$ - However, if you insist...$ - I do.$ Very well.$ Professor Haines?$ Yes.$ Yes, yes, come in.$ Come in, Doctor.$ I want you to meet Mr. Stevens and Mr. O'Halloran.$ They're making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time.$ - How do you do, gentlemen?$ - Hope we're not disturbing you, Professor.$ Not at all.$ I was just relaxing.$ Professor Haines is a most intensive worker.$ I've just been telling Mr. Stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting.$ Oh, Doctor, Doctor, come.$ Come.I want to show you.$ I want to show you a new type of brain cell.$ - That should be interesting, Professor.$ - I'm sure you'll find it so.$ - On the slide?$ - Yes.$ Look.$ Relaxing.$ Why did you bring the police in here?$ Get them out quickly, or I'll...$ Professor, do you experiment with all these animals?$ Mankind's benefactors.$ Those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human.$ Yes.$ Yes, yes, of course.$ Of course.$ But it's getting rather late, Professor, and Mr. Stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories.$ Now that he's met you, he can call some other time.$ - Delighted.$ - Thank you, Professor.$ - Glad to have met you.$ Good night.- Good night.$ Good night, gentlemen.$ There's always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so...$ He's certainly a strange type.$ Well, such men are naturally strange, Mr. Stevens.$ Sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain, another part is weakened.$ There's a type who looks capable of anything.$ Oh, I assure you, he's as timid as a lamb.$ He's inclined to be attentive to my daughter, so I see a lot of him.$ - Who's the next?$ - Dr. Rowitz.$ He's the scientist who was with Haines during the shipwreck.$ If you'll step this way.$ - Are you busy, Dr. Rowitz?$ - Always, but it's a pleasure, gentlemen.$ Oh, excuse me.$ Mr. Stevens.Mr. O'Halloran.$ - How do you do?$ - How are you?$ - Can I be of any service?$ - Well, we are just looking around, Doctor.$ - Oh, yes, of course.$ - Good evening, Professor Duke.$ - How are you feeling tonight?$ - Horrible.$ Well, I'm sorry to hear that.$ Well, if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that, then don't ask questions.$ Oh, Professor Duke, Mr. Stevens, Mr. O'Halloran.$ How do you do?How do you do?$ He's Dr. Rowitz's collaborator.$ You're an astronomer, Doctor?$ Not that, sir.$ I have an interest in the light qualities of the moon.$ If you might suffer sunstroke, might you not suffer some similar evil$ - from the rays of the moon?$ - Moonstruck, you mean?$ Exactly, what we call lunacy, from the word luna, meaning the moon.$ Latin, you know.$ However, the luna rays will never affect you or me, sir.$ - Because we are normal people.$ - Sure.$ It affects strangely certain neurotic types.$ Yes, moon is powerful.$ Why, twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world, like an eternal old scrubwoman.$ Like what?$ Pardon my poetic effort.$ Yes, but just what do you mean by that?$ I'm afraid we've taken up too much of Dr. Rowitz's time.$ Thank you, Doctor.$ That was very, very interesting.$ - Good night, gentlemen.$ - Good night.$ - Good night.$ - Good night.$ You know, this is the doctor's particular hour for observation, and the moon doesn't wait, you know.$ Did you notice the face on that fellow?$ That sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured.$ Rowitz certainly fits the description, all right.$ Gentlemen, I don't believe that Dr. Rowitz could commit a crime.$ He has such a lovely nature.$ Why, he's the author of several volumes of poetry.$ Hello?$ - What are we gonna do?$ - We're powerless unless he helps us.$ You know that as well as I do.$ We've exhausted every clue.$ He can help us find the murderer, if anybody can.$ And I'm gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it.$ A little nervous perhaps, but nothing more.$ Oh, ridiculous.$ All right.$ All right.$ You go back to sleep, dear.$ Good night.$ Doctor, if I permitted you to conduct your own investigation, how long would it take you?$ If you leave me alone,I can conduct a series of tests, which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy.$ In the meantime, I should like to check up on all your collaborators.$ Who's there?$ Hey, what're you doing up there?$ I'm a building inspector.$ I work nights so I won't get sunburned.$ I asked you what are you doing up there?$ I'm a somnambulist.$ I probably came up here to have my head examined.$ You come down from there, or I'll...$ Now, just a minute, I'll be right down, honey.$ Just relax.$ Everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up.$ I'm not used to these.$ These fire escapes are a sideline with me.$ Now everything is gonna be...$ There's nothing to worry about.$ See, Police Commissioner Stevens is upstairs, and I'm taking care of the outside.$ - By the way, what are you doing here?$ - I'm Miss Xavier.$ And we're not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes.$ I'm not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach.$ By the way, you're just the person I wanna see.$ I wanna ask you a few questions.$ Could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours?$ How do you spend your evenings?$ I mean, have you ever noticed the Doctor acting strangely?$ I'm sorry, but I can't answer those questions.$ The Doctor hasn't been very well lately, and I don't like policemen or anyone to disturb him.$ - Good night.$ - Just a minute.$ - Have you got a permit to carry that gun?$ - Yes, I have.$ Good night.$ All right.$ I'll agree to lay off for 48 hours.$ But I give you my word, if you don't succeed,I'll come in here, seal every door, place everybody under technical arrest, take fingerprints, conduct a rigid inspection.$ I don't care if the whole world knows it.$ There have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances.$ The evidence points here.$ - But, Commissioner, all I want is a chance.$ - You've got it.$ - Forty-eight hours.$ Good night, Doctor.$ - Good night.$ Good night, gentlemen.$ Meddling fools.$ This way out, gentlemen.$ If you please.$ - Who're you?$ - I am Dr. Xavier's butler, sir.$ My nerves are all shot.$ That dumb, potbellied, flat-footed cop.$ I dashed that off in five minutes.$ I think it's pretty swell.$ - What do you think?$ - It's okay.$ But you stick on Dr. X's trail, and you get a picture of the Doctor and a statement, too.$ Oh, no, not me.$ Listen, I wanna get off this story.$ Put me back on crossword puzzles, covering woman's clubs,$ - anything, will you?$ - Say, what's the matter with you?$ What's the matter with me?$ Nothing at all.$ Only I spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs, looking at a lot of goofy guys.$ I let a dame poke a gun in my stomach, and then I let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar.$ Say, you want to draw another paycheck, don't you?$ Certainly, that's my aim in life, but I'd like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it.$ Eddie, when is Lee Taylor's week up?$ Oh, wait a minute.$ Wait a minute.$ Can't you take a joke?$ All right, keep moving, but get a picture of the Doctor.$ Here, have a cigar.$ How do you do?$ I'm Mr. Taylor.$ - You ain't a reporter, are you?$ - I should say not.$ Well, that's good.$ We've been overrun with them all morning.$ - Gee, they got us goofy.$ - I know just how you feel, Miss Xavier.$ - I ain't Miss Xavier.$ - Well, that's funny.$ I was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20.$ I'm 21-and-a-half.$ Oh, fine.$ Pleased to meet you.$ Gee, ain't you the kidder, though.$ That's another thing in your favor.$ That shows that you have a sense of humor.$ What do you want the miss for?$ - My grandmother sent me.$ - Your grandmother?$ Won't you take these flowers?$ - For the miss.$ - Come in.$ Just a minute.$ Miss Joan, there's a man down here wants you for his grandmother.$ - I beg your pardon?$ - Oh, how do you do?$ I didn't know you...$ I'm awfully sorry.$ You know, I felt sure that I'd hear you coming before you entered.$ Well, I suppose I could go back and cough.$ Oh, no, no, please don't bother.Stay right here.$ - You're sure I'm not disturbing you?$ - Not at all.Why do you ask?$ You're so obviously at home here that I feel like a guest.$ - You don't mind if I sit down?$ - Oh, please do.$ Oh, how nice.$ Thank you.$ And since you're my guest, won't you...$ - Won't you want a cigarette?$ - No.$ What I want is to know if you're really going to take it.$ - Going to take it?$ - Yes, my picture.$ It's sticking out of your right pocket.$ Well, isn't that the funniest thing?$ You know, this is really all your own fault.$ You have absolutely no business photographing so attractively.$ - Thank you.$ - And I have a habit of collecting pictures$ - of beautiful girls.$ - Yeah.$ - Well, and pictures of their fathers, too?$ - Pictures of their fathers...$ What fathers?$ My father's picture's sticking out of your left pocket.$ Well, can you beat that?How do you suppose that got there?$ Just who are you, anyway?$ Because you're such a good scout, I'm gonna break down and confess and tell you.$ I'm Lee Taylor of The Daily World.$ - Then you did it.$ - Me?$ It was you who printed that horrible story of Father in this morning's paper.$ - Horrible?$ You ain't read nothing yet.$ - What do you mean?$ What I mean is...Well, don't you see?$ Your father's a famous scientist.$ He's been called in on a sensational case.$ - That's news.$ - But you've upset him terribly.$ Now, on account of that newspaper story, he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation.$ - He hates publicity.$ - You mean to tell me he's leaving town?$ Who's going with him?$ What time are they leaving?$ - What station...$ - That's none of your business.$ I refuse to say another word to you.$ You're just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it.$ Oh, impudent, maybe, but not contemptible.$ - Don't call me contemptible.$ - You are contemptible.$ You deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer.$ Well, I merely showed you my police press badge.$ Don't you think you've been here a very long time?$ Listen, honestly, I am ashamed.$ But don't you see?$ This is the biggest thing that's happened in this town in six months.$ If I don't get something on this story, why, I'll have to join the army of the unemployed,$ - and you wouldn't want that to happen.$ - I'd be very grateful to you if you'd leave.$ I didn't quite get that.$ Yeah, would you say it again?$ A little closer.$ You hard of hearing?$ No, no, but don't you see?$ That's the closest thing to anything coaxing that you've said yet.$ - You get out of here.$ - Oh, don't be angry.$ Come on, let's laugh it off.$ - Won't you shake hands and be friends?$ - No.$ Lucky.$ I've got to get something on this story, or I'm out of a job.$ Hey!$ Take this home to your grandmother.$ Bad luck.$ There is no need to be temperamental.$ We are here on a matter of the utmost gravity.$ That's why I've sent for you so unceremoniously.$ We are all under suspicion of murder.$ - What?$ - Absurd.$ - Ridiculous.$ - What imbecile thought that up?$ Gentlemen, I know you're all acquainted with these recent horrible murders.$ Moon Killer murders, as the press calls them.$ The investigation has proven that, in every case, the killer has made use of a surgical instrument, a type to be found only in our academy.$ - But, Doctor...$ - One moment, please.$ Naturally, I prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent, but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty, any one of us.$ Confound it, Xavier.$ Bring us up here on a night like this.$ Why couldn't you have told us this at the academy?$ For a simple reason.$ I wish to conduct an investigation of my own, alone, quietly.$ And I want your help.$ This is a lot of tommyrot.$ Don't you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us?$ You are quite right, Doctor.What do you propose to do?$ I want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test, an experiment that I have devised, which I hope will prove each one of us innocent.$ But if it should prove otherwise?$ Then, my dear Doctor, surely one's own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law.$ - This is preposterous.$ I refuse.$ - Good.$ Then the police will give it to you.$ Gentlemen, I consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence.$ - Doctor, I'm ready.$ - Thank you, Dr. Rowitz.$ - Dr. Wells?$ - Yes.$ - Professor Duke?$ - I agree.$ - And you, Professor Haines?$ - Well, if they all agree.$ - Good.$ - Oh, I think it's a lot of nonsense.$ Gentlemen, I suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack.$ In 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory.$ A still?$ Wonder where they bottle it.$ Bad luck.$ You and me both.$ Very well, Doctor.$ At once.$ Your room is at the end of the corridor.$ Mine's over there.$ I just fixed yours for the night.$ Is there anything else, miss?$ Why, Mamie, what's the matter with you?$ Your teeth are chattering.$ This terrible house.$ It gives me the horrors worse than ever.$ Well, don't be absurd.$ Go to bed and go to sleep.$ Well, I hope you get a good night's sleep.$ - Good night.$ - Good night, Mamie.$ Good night.$ Come, Mamie.$ Come.$ Come, Mamie.$ How would you like to meet a ghost in here, eh, Mamie?$ Well, I'll tell you one thing.$ He'd be a lot pleasanter than you.$ Stop that, Otto.$ Stop it.$ There ain't anything in this room to be afraid of.$ So you can just stop trying to make me nervous.$ Well, well, Mr. Zilch, how are you?$ The smells, don't they remind you of an embalming parlor, eh, Mamie?$ The only thing in this room that does that right now is you.$ Yes, you can laugh now, if you want to, but you won't laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment.$ - Where did Dr. Xavier get that?$ - From the morgue.$ The old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered.$ Look, Mamie, look here.$ You can see some of the blood on them.$ - No, Otto!$ No, please, Otto!$ No, no!$ - Look, Mamie.Look, Mamie.$ Yes.$ - I take back what I said, please.$ - Look, Mamie, look.$ Otto, Mamie, what's wrong with the switchboard?$ What's going on here?$ - Nothing, sir.$ - Yes, there is, Doctor.$ - He's trying to scare me.$ - Otto, stop this foolishness.$ - Yes, sir.$ - Now, pay attention, both of you.$ - You have the dress, Otto?$ - Right here, sir.$ Mamie, you'll kindly put it on.$ - Put in on?But, Doctor...$ - Now, I want your help.$ You and Otto will enact the last murder of the so-called Moon Killer before an audience I've selected.$ Otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part.$ - What part do I play?$ - The scrubwoman, of course.$ - The one who was murdered last night.$ - Murdered?$ But, Doctor, please, please.$ Couldn't Otto play it?$ No, Otto has his own part, that of the killer.$ There's nothing to be afraid of.$ Remember our signals, Otto.$ Just as I explained.$ Yes, sir.$ You see, Mamie, there's nothing to be afraid of.$ There's nothing...$ How've you been, babe?$ Now, cut it out, now, will you?$ Cut it out.$ You're right.$ There's nothing like this way.$ How utterly absurd.$ Good heavens, Doctor, what have you done with your laboratory here?$ It's nothing like it was at my last visit.$ - I've made a few changes, that's all.$ - A thousand, I should say.$ Thermal tubes, huh?$ A blood reaction, by high frequency current, as well.$ Dr. Xavier is still working on his theory that strong mental repressions, phobias, hidden in the darkest corners of the subconscious mind can be brought to the surface and made to register through certain reactions of the heart.$ - Am I correct, Professor?$ - Precisely.$ And tonight I hope to prove my theory.$ Now, gentlemen, would you kindly be seated in these chairs?$ We'll begin the experiment.$ Well, if we must, then let us get it over with quickly.$ Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines and Professor Duke.$ And now, gentlemen, with your permission,Dr. Wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists.$ Are yours included?$ Certainly.$ As close as possible.$ But, see that the connections aren't too tight.$ You'll be quite comfortable.$ Pardon me a moment, Doctor, as I attach the contact clamp.$ That's it.$ Thank you.$ Did I have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you?$ I'm sure you'll forgive me in just a few moments.$ - We're ready, Professor.$ - The moon.$ Perfect.$ - Just as though we'd ordered it.$ - Close those curtains.$ Give me the shivers.Moon shining right in my face.$ - Oh, no, no.$ No, leave them alone.$ - Close them!$ - Shall I?$ - All right, you may close them, Wells.$ Now, listen, please, to what I have to say.$ One of us in this room may be a murderer.$ A murderer who killed by the light of a full moon, leaving his victim's body mutilated.$ A cannibal.$ Evidence shows the killer has two hands.$ Therefore, only Wells is eliminated.$ So I shall ask him to work the apparatus.$ Wells?$ Wells?$ How about me?$ A hopeless paralytic.$ Silence, please, Professor.$ Wells, will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet?$ Yes, Doctor.$ I'm going to leave you for a moment now, while I check the variability of your blood reactions.$ I suggest that you remain silent during my absence.$ Wells, the young quack.$ Had him for an intern before he could grow a beard.$ If you ask me, I think Dr. Xavier is using very unethical methods.$ Necessity has no ethics, sir.$ Gentlemen, I am now turning on the 100-milliampere, high-frequency coil.$ Your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators, and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4,000 times.$ The rotor of the electrostatic machine is connected in multiple series with a bank of glass-plate condensers, and the discharge causes irradiations to the thermal tubes, which, in turn, indicate your increased pulse rate and nerve reactions.$ We can proceed now.$ One moment, Doctor.$ Were the murdered women attacked?$ Does your mind never run into any other channel?$ What do you mean by that statement?$ I mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far, Dr. Haines.$ - You, you...$ - Silence, gentlemen, please.$ Now, it is my theory that one of us in the past, through dire necessity, was driven to cannibalism.$ The memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man.$ Shrewd and brilliant, he could conceal his madness from the human eye.$ Even from himself.$ But he can't conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity.$ Every time his heart beats from mental excitement, the thermal tubes will betray him.$ You are all now connected with these tubes.$ I am myself.$ But I alone know which tube is yours.$ Your heart beats are being reflected before you.$ Doctor, I protest!$ As the heart beats faster and faster, so does that red liquid begin to pulse and rise until terror takes hold of the subject, and the liquid rises to the very top of the tube.$ He whose tube does that is the guilty man.$ Here are a line of wax figures, lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims, people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires.$ First, a woman of the streets, killed in the tenement district.$ Her body found late at night in a gutter.$ The next victim, a middle-aged woman, killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market.$ Her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront.$ Then, a dope fiend, strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall.$ Next, a beautiful young girl, violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness.$ Oh, I'm so afraid.$ I'm shaking like a leaf.$ Keep quiet.$ Get ready.$ Watch.$ You're about to see reenacted the murder of the killer's latest victim.$ An old scrubwoman.$ She's coming home from work.$ It's late.$ A full moon shines down upon her.$ She's passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out, starts creeping towards her.$ As old Annie stoops to pick up a newspaper, the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands.$ Get your hands off me, Otto.$ You're hurting my throat.$ - Turn on the lights!$ - Someone's coming in the room!$ Stop it, stop it, I can't stand any more!$ Xavier, turn on the lights!$ I can't get my breath.$ - The lights!$ - Look at that tube.$ It's a success.$ The guilty man is...$ The guilty man is Rowitz.$ Rowitz.$ Look, what's happened to him?$ - He's been murdered.$ - Let me see.$ What's the matter?What has happened?$ Stabbed in the base of the brain.$ Murdered like all the other Moon Killer victims.$ - Who was sitting on his left side?$ - I was, but I didn't see anything.$ I was watching the experiment.$ Duke, you're walking!$ I walked.$ You saw me.$ You saw me, I walked.$ I walked.$ - You walked?$ You faker, you killed him.$ - Quiet, Haines.$ Don't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it?$ - Otto, help him.$ - Take it easy, Doctor.$ You'll need all your strength for your work tonight.$ Wells?Where's Wells?$ The contacts are broken.$ Why doesn't he come in?$ Take him to another room.$ Wells!$ Wells!$ Wells!$ Wells!$ Wells!$ Wells!What's wrong, man?$ I don't know.$ The lights went out.$ Someone called my name.$ I started for the laboratory, and someone struck me.$ Oh, this is terrible!$ Easy, now.Let me help you.$ I will be all right in just a moment.$ Watch your head.$ Are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test?$ No one.$ Nothing unusual happened until I was struck.$ Father, something terrible has happened to Dr. Rowitz.$ - I just saw him...$ - Now, Joanne, dear, be calm.$ Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident.$ - I wish you'd go back to your room.$ - He's dead?$ You can't do anything here, Joanne.$ It's best that you go back to your room.$ - Your father will explain everything later.$ - Now, come, Joanne.$ Come.$ Doctor.$ Doctor.$ - What is it, Haines?$ - There's someone hiding in this closet.$ What?$ Another one?$ Who is it?$ He's the young man who was at the house today.$ He fainted.$ - Some water, Otto, quickly.$ - Yes, sir.$ I took the liberty of having something on hand$ - for just such an occasion, sir.$ - Thank you.$ Here, young man, drink this.$ How's that, huh?$ It's not bad.How much do you pay for it?$ He's all right now.$ What were you doing in that closet?$ - Hiding.$ - Who are you?$ Lee Taylor, The Daily World.$ You wouldn't give me a break, so I had to take it.$ - You're lying.$ - Don't be absurd.$ He is a newspaper man.$ He's the one who printed the story about you in yesterday's World.$ I'm sorry.$ You see, I had to get the story.$ I was hiding in there, and everything was going great, when all of a sudden, well, I guess I just fainted.$ It's gonna be kind of tough if I have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life.$ Yes, well, newspaper man or not, you're an impostor.$ I don't like your methods.$ I shall hand you over to the police.$ - Otto...$ - That suits me.$ I'll phone my story in from the police station.$ - You'll phone no story.$ - Father, let me talk to him, will you?$ I can't let this story get out now.$ It'd ruin everything.$ But, Father, please let me talk to him.$ Mr. Taylor.$ Just in case.$ - You're not gonna let him go?$ - Certainly not.$ Otto, watch him.$ Don't let him get near a phone or leave this house.$ Yes, sir.$ Oh, no, no.$ I'm absolutely all right.$ Now don't...$ Don't you worry about me.$ I gotta dash off to my newspaper.$ - See, they won't wait.$ - Mr. Taylor.$ You don't have to report to the paper what you've just seen, do you?$ I'm sorry, but I've got to.$ You see, this is the most sensational case that's broken in six months...$ I know.But can't you wait?$ Won't you give Father a chance to find out who's doing it?$ What difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him?$ It makes a lot of difference.$ The public want to read about it.$ The more sensational it is, the more the son-of-a-guns love it.$ Is that all you think about?$ Sensationalism?$ Don't you ever think about people's feelings?$ Can't you realize what a scandal would do to my father's institution?$ Certainly I can, but don't you realize that I'm in a hard-boiled racket?$ Then, why don't you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us?$ Aren't we going through enough trouble?$ Look at the trouble I've been through to get this story.$ I lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs.$ I looked at a lot of goofy guys.$ I let a dumb policeman...Will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with Father in the morning?$ I tell you what I'll do.$ I'll hold off on this story, and I'll stay, if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning.$ I think it can be arranged.$ Father usually has breakfast at 7: 30.$ - And you?$ - Oh, I am lazy.$ I have mine at 9: 00.$ Oh, you have no idea how lazy I am.$ - Could I have mine at 9: 00?$ - Possibly.$ And will you take me for a swim afterwards?$ - A swim?$ - At the beach.$ If you're so helpless you can't find the water, you've no business in it.$ But I like the water and...$ I am sorry, miss, I had no intention of disturbing you.$ That's okay, Otto.$ - There's old man bad luck again.$ - I am sorry.$ That's all right, Otto.$ I'm glad you're here.$ Mr. Taylor's staying for the night.$ I'd like you to prepare a room for him.$ I have already done so, miss.$ May I suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight?$ - He is very tired.$ - That's a good idea, Otto.$ Are you going swimming with me in the morning?$ No, thanks.$ Good night.$ What will you do if I start to sink and yell for help?$ Throw you an anvil.$ Good night.$ This way, sir.$ - Do you sleep very soundly, sir?$ - Like a rock.$ - I'm sorry to hear that.$ - Why?$ Because this is a very strange house.$ - You're telling me.$ - This way, if you please.$ Father.$ Father.$ Father?$ Father!$ Joanne.$ What are you doing here?$ Well, dear, I just wanted to be sure that the incision was made by a brain scalpel.$ Come.$ - Professor Haines.$ - Haines, why are you here?$ I couldn't sleep.$ So I came down here to make a more thorough examination of the body.$ Professor, I...$ Father, will you please come to bed?$ All right, darling, now, you run along, and I'll be right up.$ -

Are you staying?- Yes.$ All right.$ Then I'm staying too.$ Your father is right.$ - My husband!- Still up at this hour?$ You missed the train?$ No, but as I was boarding, I saw Dr. Cigalon, and he told me that -$ As you see, we have visitors.$ You're back?$ Just for a few hours.Tell us.$ Did you miss the train?$ Dr. Cigalon told me Miette's child has had whooping cough for a week.$ And she didn't tell us anything.$ She'd been borrowing toys.$ She just brought this doll back yesterday.$ Whooping cough is a terrible disease.$ It's an invisible germ, tinier than a mosquito.$ Look as you may, you can't see it.$ It has terrible hooks.$ It jumps on children and clamps onto their throats.$ They suffer terribly.$ Did he touch this?$ How is the boy?$ - A bit warm.$ I'll give that Miette a piece of my mind when I see her tomorrow.$ Don't worry.$ Go and take his temperature.$ How long will you be on leave?$ That depends.$ On your captain?$ On Fanny and you.$ At least that's clear and frank.$ I don't understand.$ In the past, as today, and even when I was far away,I always considered Fanny my fiancée.$ " Considered" -

His temperature?- Normal.$ He's no more got whooping cough than I do.$ Now, what is it you want exactly?$ I made a mistake two years ago.$ But why should that ruin several people's lives?$ - What people?$ - Fanny, me, Dad and my son.$ What about me?$ You've had two good years, and I'm grateful for what you did.$ But now you must give me back what is mine.$ That's pushing it a bit.$ He's quick to ask others to make sacrifices.$ Well, here's my answer.$ When I see you two together, I feel like an intruder.$ Maybe I should do the decent thing and kill myself.$ I'd willingly die for you, Fanny.$ But, if I died, I'd never see my boy again.$ So I absolutely refuse.$ No one is asking you to.$ No one is asking me, but I ask it of myself.$ Don't feel pity for me.$ If you still love this young man, forget me.$ You're free to go.$ What you say is very fine and selfless, but there's the child.$ The child is ours!$ You want me to give up the child too?$ Take my eyes, my heart - but not him!$ So much for your generosity!$ You give the wife but keep the child!$ Perhaps you figure the wife won't leave without the child!$ If you're sincere, give me back my son.$ No, Marius, you will not have the boy!$ You may persuade his mother.$ Or she may ask for him one day, but don't you try.$ You're young.$ You can have other children.$ Let me keep mine.$ He's my only son, my first and last!$ I would never take him from you.$ An ordinary child I might part with, but this one is a marvel.$ Marius, you were a handsome boy, but he's even more handsome.$ All this is very fine but...$ - He coughed.$ - I didn't hear a thing.$ - Maybe not, but I did.$ And he's gone.$ The cough is more important than all this.$ If he's mine, I should do the worrying.$ Exactly.$ But you don't.$ Marius, he's not yours.$ You were only his father before he was born.$ Once a father, always a father.$ When the baby was born, he weighed nine pounds.$ Nine pounds of his mother's flesh.$ Now he weighs 20.$ You know what those other 11 pounds are made of?$ Love.$ And yet love weighs very little.$ You need a lot of love to make 11 pounds.$ I gave my share, and so did Fanny.$ But Panisse contributed the most.$ And what have you given?$ Life.$ Dogs give life too.$ No, Marius.$ You didn't want that child.$ All you wanted was pleasure.$ You didn't give him life.$ He took it.$ It's not the same thing.$ Who's the father?$ The giver of life, or the one who buys the baby food?$ The father is the one who loves.$ Marius, you were the father of a bastard.$ You were the father of a child without a name, borne by a poor, desperate girl.$ Where is that child?He doesn't exist.$ That's not my child.$ Mine was born in a nice, large bed, surrounded by his family.$ Don't try to bite off more than you can chew.$ You can't have that child.$ He's too firmly rooted in his family.$ - So you betray me too.$ No, Marius, I never betrayed you.$ I have never betrayed our love.$ Since your father is here to save us from ourselves,I can tell you everything.$ I love you.$ I still love you.$ I love you as much as before, if not more.$ Every morning, I see you in my son's smile.$ When you came in tonight, I nearly fainted.$ If you'd taken my hand, I would have gone with you.$ I'd have gone anywhere with you.$ - But then...What about my son?- He's ours!$ You have only to take him!$ The law and God forbid it.$ Panisse saved me.$ He gave me his name, and he gave me my self-respect back.$ In labor I drove my nails into his hands.$ He told me," Bite me.Scratch me."$ " The more you hurt me, the more he's mine."$ And he endured it the whole night.$ He still bears the scars.$ He bears the scars, Marius.$ Not you.$ Go away.$ Go back to sea.$ That's what you wanted.$ Leave me here with our child.$ But remember this, if it will console you.$ There's someone thinking of you every night.$ A girl who'd like to lie beside you, sleeping in your warmth.$ Who'd like to wake up with your arms around her, stroke your hair and put her hands on your drowsy lips.$ What do you want me to do?$ Catch your train.$ - You send me on my way too!$ She can't wait for me to be gone either.$ Don't be hard on her.$ She loves you.$ She told you so.$ But her heart goes one way and her body the other.$ It's not her heart that loves you.$ She's the one to be pitied the most.$ None of us is sending you away.Neither me, her or Panisse.$ But you're a danger to your child's future.$ He's the one sending you away.$ And you don't take my side.$ Dad, don't you love me anymore?$ Of course I still love you, you fool.$ Only you're a grown-up man, and he's little.$ He's so little.$ That's what makes him strong.$ Little children take everything.$ But it's better not to wait for them to take things.$ Just give instead.$ I'm off.$ Say good-bye to Madame Panisse.$ I'll never love anyone but you.$ I've never loved anyone but you.$ BASED ON THE PLAY BY MARCEL PAGNOL$

lady, lady, will you give me a job?$ I haven't had work since...$ Since Camille left town?$ Hey, Joe, where's Ruth?$ She went somewhere with Romer.$ He's got a crust dragging her away from the party.$ Don't be a chump all your life.$ She probably did the dragging.$ She'd ditch you any day for Romer.$ Oh, yeah?$ Well, I'll find out when they get back.$ Lovely back, darling.$ Pleasant here, isn't it?$ Yes.$ It would have been a shame for you to have missed it.$ I'd begun to think you weren't coming to the party.$ Well, I've begun to think I didn't.$ There, now, you see, we'll have to start all over again.$ Pleasant here, isn't it?Mmm-hmm.$ How are your folks?$ Father, smoking.$ Mother, fuming.$ Worried about you?$ About me?$ Of course not.$ No, I'm supposed to be murdering moths.$ Mother hates for me not to.$ What a wise mother.$ She knows what the moths do when the flame is away.$ Does she know you're with me?$ I'm with Conny.Didn't you know?$ Well, all's fair, you know.$ Why, I'd murder just to see the soft green shadows through that pine tree on your lovely hair.$ A girl's pretty helpless alone with you.$ Why?$ Nothing to resent but compliments, and they're said to paralyze a lady.$ Really?$ Well!$ You know, your hair is like the sun glowing on the waters.$ And your eyes are like the evening skies that send their first stars down to lovers.$ Your lovely arms...$ Isn't this one feeling just a little paralyzed?$ Goodness me, Mr. Sheffield, yes, but I recover just like that!$ I think I'm able to be up and about.$ In fact, I'd like a wee cocktail.$ Please don't go so soon.$ Well, a girl can't go on forever calling her little policemen.$ All right, I'll promise, so help me, to be good.$ But there's the most divine little spot further along the shore.$ Let me show you it, will you?$ Promise I can have it without a stroke of paralysis?$ Yes, you can see it without a stroke of any kind.$ Come on, be a good winner.$ I can't resist you, except when you're dangerous.$ Hello, Conny.$ Well, it's about time you're getting back.$ I'm terribly sorry, Conny.$ I guess it's entirely my fault.$ Yeah, I thought it would be.$ Yes.$ Well, you see, we got to talking about mutual friends.$ Say, Conny, did you ever read Alice in Wonderland?$ Say, what are you trying to do, kid me?$ WOMAN:Hey, shake a leg!$ MAN:$ See you over there.Don't fail us, Romer.$ Has everyone gone?$ Nearly everyone.$ They're over at the Springs.$ Gee, I'm sorry they broke up so early.$ They all want you to come over there.$ No, I don't think I will.$ Thanks awfully, Conny.$ Make it snappy, Ruth.$ I'll go get the car.$ All right.$ I'm sorry Conny acted that way.$ I don't blame him.$ Archie!$ Hello.$ Well, you know, I could've bet that this thing wouldn't hold two quarts, but it holds four.$ Look.$ Well, Archie, I'm glad you're still here, because I want you to do me a favor.$ Oh, sure.$ Look, I can't join the crowd over at the Springs, but would you mind taking these two quarts over with my compliments?$ Sure I will.$ Well, I gotta get the car.$ Gee, thanks a lot, Romer.$ Don't mention it.$ It was swell.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye.$ So long, Ruth.$ That was awfully decent of you, Romer.$ Sometimes I surprise myself, really.$ So you finally got back.$ Yes.You sound surprised.$ Did you expect me to be gone all night?$ Well, dear, I didn't know.$ You see, a girl in your position can afford to be so much more unconventional in her pleasures than I could.$ What's the matter?$ Shut up!I didn't say anything.$ I know you didn't.$ Then why did you tell me to shut up?$ Well, how do you like my guest room?$ Light, airy, comfortable and modern.$ Why look further?$ I wouldn't be interested in a short-term lease.$ Goodbye, Romer.$ Bye-bye.$ Well, this is once you didn't keep me waiting.$ I didn't dare.$ Open all the windows Turn the fan on, too$ I'm ablaze, I'm in a daze I'm burning for you$ Call the fire engine And the whole darn crew$ Tell them all to hurry'Cause I'm burning for you$ I try to cool off But when you say no$ I'm a volcano What can I do$ Would you let me smother Leave me in a stew$ Go on and tell your mother That I'm burning for you$ Open all the windows Turn that fan on, too$ I'm ablaze, I'm in a daze I'm burning for you$ Call that fire engine And the whole darn crew$ Tell them all to hurry'Cause I'm burning for you$ I try to cool off But when you say no$ I'm a volcano What can I do$ Would you let me smother Leave me in a stew$ Go on and tell your mother That I'm burning for you$ Let's grab a boat and cool off, or have you run away from the crowd enough for one day?$ Conny, why do you keep harping on that?$ You know I'd love to go out on the lake.$ Okay.$ Let's get out before somebody else horns in on the ride.$ Conny's a fool.$ Why?Letting Ruth drag him off outside just like the rest of the fellows that chase her.$ He's no fool.$ Enjoy your ride?$ It was great.$ It's much nicer out here.$ I'll say it is.$ Let's have one of your best putt-putts.$ This is it.$ Hop right in, beautiful, and pick yourself a nice, soft seat.$ Okay.MAN:$ All right.$ Please don't, Conny.$ Come on, you're too far away.$ No, I'm all right where I am.$ Can't you ever enjoy a boat ride without kissing somebody?$ Oh, all right.$ Pretty cove.$ Yes, it is.$ What's the idea?$ Why not?$ You're not going to high-hat me all day, are you?$ Conny, be your age!$ You know I don't like that caveman stuff.$ You'll love it, beautiful.$ I came out here to cool off, not to have a wrestling match.$ I see.$ You like Romer's petting better than mine, huh?$ I don't like the way your ears are put on.$ Let's go back.$ And make a sap out of me twice in one day?$ Nothing doing.$ I've got a little coming to me.$ What do you expect for a boat ride, Marlene Dietrich?$ Don't play dumb.$ You've been on these parties before.$ RUTH:Conny!$ Good night, Eva.$ Good night.$ Good night, Archie.$ Eva, Conny isn't back yet.$ Did you ever know Ruth to bring a fellow back this early?$ Sure.$ Who?$ Me.$ Oh, Archie!$ Hello.$ Why, hello, Ruth.$ Here, take this cushion.$ I'm too tired to move.$ Come on.$ Thanks.$ I suppose you're wondering why I'm here.$ Well, you're here.$ I can't think of anything more important.$ Ruth!$ Ruth!$ Would it interest you to know that I've wanted you ever since I first saw you in the bank?$ You're supposed to see things you want in banks.$ Yes, and the moment you go to get them, burglar alarms start ringing all over town.$ May I pay you a compliment?$ No, no, not one of those haymakers.$ It's just this.I've known many women.$ Never have I met one so warm, so desirable and so unapproachable.$ You know, I surprise myself admiring the mind in you.$ You don't mind my mentioning it since it's there, do you?$ No.$ As a matter of fact, it all comes down to this, a man would have to be very stupid to touch you without first knowing your heart.$ There, you didn't think brains could do that for you, did you?$ I hadn't given it much thought.$ Is Listerine good for brains?$ Love, they tell me, is better.$ If it lasts.$ Well, what does it matter, so long as one finds happiness?$ Did you ever regret being happy?$ No, but I would if that happiness meant being sneered at and scorned and talked about.$ You don't know what it is to live in a small town.$ You can only play on the surface.$ And even if you're honest about that, you're not safe from a lot of evil-minded people.$ The only security in a place like this is settling down and getting married.$ Marriage, ownership.$ Dreadful thought, isn't it?$ One drink for Sheffield!$ Say, tell me something.$ How can you be so morbid after what happened last night?$ What about last night?$ Well, for heaven's sake, girl, don't you remember where you were?$ I was home in bed, asleep at 10: 00.$ No, no, no, there must be some mistake.$ You and I were in Venice.$ And our rooms opened onto the Gardens and the Grand Canal.$ And we watched the moon play across the walls, and listened to that gondolier singing as he paddled down the canal.$ Romer, a check of yours for $ 10,000 came into the bank today, made out to Camille Renault.$ It was torn.$ You wanted us to put it through, didn't you?$ Yeah.$ You know, Ruth, you're strangely honest, sometimes painfully so.$ Will you make me a promise?$ What is it?$ Well, if ever you find out you're wrong about what you think is security and happiness, would you let me know?$ Even if I'm in Switzerland, will you send me a cablegram?$ Well, I'm not wrong, but I'll promise.$ Good.$ Let's drink to it.$ To what?$ To your being wrong.$ No, thank you!$ Somebody's coming.$ Sit still.$ It's just a car passing.$ Hello, Conny, I couldn't imagine who it was.$ Yeah, I'll bet you couldn't.Where's Ruth?$ Why, hasn't she been with you?$ Quit stalling.$ Now, who was the girl I just saw go in the house?$ You know, Conny, you seem to have an amazing curiosity.$ Yeah, enough to find out if that was Ruth.$ Don't you think it's more agreeable here on the veranda?$ No, I don't!$ I suppose those aren't Ruth's shoes, huh?$ Conny, I think you ought to go into town.$ Yeah?Well, Ruth's going with me, you big stiff!$ You know, it's much cooler in town.$ You'll remember this!$ Yeah, that's right.I always remember pleasant experiences.$ Ruth!$ Ruth!$ The young lady has gone, sir.$ Where?She told Frank you wished him to drive her home.$ Frank!$ Wait a minute!$ You forgot these.$ Thank you.$ Good night.$ Let me out at this corner.$ Look.$ Thank you.$ So she ditched Conny again and went back to see Romer.$ Yeah, it sure looks like it.$ And afterward he sends her into town in his car.$ Why didn't she stay all night?$ Hot potatoes!$ Who are you?$ Ruth!$ Bill Fadden!$ I can hardly believe it's you!$ It is.$ Are you sure?$ Turn around.$ Haven't changed a bit.$ Where are your pigtails?$ Well, a girl has to grow up and bob her hair sometime.$ Well, go on, eat your pie and tell me all about it.$ What are you doing here, and why?$ I've got to do a geological survey for the oil company.$ Where?$ Up around Black Mountain.$ I wanna pitch camp in the old Indian cave.Oh.$ So you turned out to be a geologist.$ Yeah, anticlines, fossils, sedimentary deposits and all.$ Sounds awful!$ It's a great game, Ruth, I'm out in the field 10 months a year.$ Are you still afraid of girls?$ No.$ I'm not very used to them.$ Never see any from one month to another.$ And couldn't figure them out if you did.$ Well, anyway, I...$ I wanted to see you again, a lot.$ Did you have a good time tonight?$ Sure.$ Great.$ Your father told me they've built a new dance hall right down on the lakefront.$ Yes.$ Willow Grove, or something.$ Yes.$ Now, that's too bad.$ I guess the lake isn't the same anymore.$ The same?$ I was just remembering how peaceful it used to be.$ I guess you'd find it changed, all right.$ Good night.$ See you in the morning.$ See you at breakfast.$ Hello.$ Hello, Conny.$ How about a date this afternoon?$ Why don't you call up Ruth?$ She ought to be very interesting now.$ I'm fed up with her!$ Why?$ Because she ran out on you again last night?$ Well, how did you know?$ Because I saw her coming home in Romer Sheffield's car.$ You did, huh?$ What time?$ About 2: 30 this morning.$ Ruth Brock?$ What time did she leave you?$ Why, when we left the dance.$ She ducked while I went out to get a boat.$ Why, that was only about 10: 00.$ Didn't she even go out in the boat with you?$ Well, if she had, she would have come back with me, wouldn't she?$ Then she must have been at Sheffield's house for more than four hours.$ How awful!$ All right, Conny.$ Come out about 2: 30 this afternoon.$ Yes.$ Goodbye.$ Do you mean to say that you actually sawRuth Brock in Romer Sheffield's car?$ Yes, Auntie.Isn't it terrible?$ Why, she must have been at his house for more than four hours.$ I didn't think Ruth was that kind of a girl.$ I've seen it coming for a long time.$ She's always been encouraging men.$ Number, please.$ Hello.$ Hello.$ Matilda?Matilda, I've just heard the most awful news.$ Ruth Brock was in Romer Sheffield's house with him alone last night.$ Yes, yes, from about 10: 00 until 2: 30.$ And then he sent her home to town in his car.$ Yes.$ Number, please.$ Number, please.$ Number, please.$ An affair with Romer Sheffield.Yes, yes.$ I'll call you back later.$ Number, please.$ Yes, someone saw them silhouetted against the curtain of the upstairs bedroom.$ He was holding her in his arms.$ Yes, she was there till 3: 30.$ OPERATOR:Number, please.$ She spent the night with him.$ They saw her coming into town this morning in his car, just at dawn.$ OPERATOR:Number, please.$ How long are you going to be gone, Bill?$ About a week.$ I want to make some pictures and maps and get some rock specimens.$ I wish you didn't have to go so soon.$ It's probably just as well.$ If I didn't, I think I'd find myself falling in love with you again.$ Again?$ Sure.$ When we were kids, I used to think you were swell.$ In spite of the pigtails.$ But now you know better, don't you?$ I'm beginning to doubt it.$ I never forgot you.$ I've always remembered you, too, Bill.$ But memories can't turn to love in one day.$ MAN:All ready, Mr. Fadden.$ Right with you.$ Wish you could drive up and spend an afternoon exploring with me.$ Around Black Mountain with compass and camera.$ That's about it.Do you think you could?$ Bill, I'm a working girl.$ But I may be able to get a day off.$ Good.$ I hope so.$ Headquarters, the cave.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye, Bill.$ Bye-bye.$ WOMAN:Yes, indeed, and I believe every word of it.$ There isn't a doubt.$ Mrs. Winchell, Mrs. Starr, how do you do?$ Hello, Ruth, darling.$ Miss Brock, I've decided to dispense with your services.$ I'm giving you two weeks' salary in place of notice.$ But why, Mr. Randolph?$ There isn't enough work for Mr. Franklin to need you any longer.$ That's not the reason, Mr. Randolph.$ I've had plenty of work to do.$ What is it?$ I don't care to argue the matter with you, Miss Brock, except to say that the moral conduct of our employees is a very important consideration.$ That's all, Miss Brock.$ Dad.$ Hello, Ruth.$ Where's Mother?$ Out somewhere.$ Why, what's the matter, honey?$ You've been crying.$ I just got fired.$ You did?$ What for?$ Well, it seems I'm an immoral woman, and immoral women shouldn't work in banks, you know.$ They might corrupt the young dollar bills.$ Did Ned Randolph call you that?$ What are you going to do?$ I'm going to make him eat every word of it.$ The lying, ungrateful dog!$ I gave him his...$ No, no, Dad, it wouldn't be any use.$ So you got yourself fired from the bank and came sneaking home.$ Bad news sure travels fast.$ Well, what have you got to say for yourself?$ Mother, I didn't do anything to...$ Don't you stand there and lie to me.$ Why, the whole town's talking about you and sneering at you.$ I might have known you'd do something to disgrace the family.$ Painting your face and staying out nights with a lot of rotten young whelps!$ You would end up in a vile affair with Romer Sheffield.$ Why, Mother, how can you say such a...$ MR. BROCK:Ida, that's a lie!$ Is it?$ Well, ask her.Weren't you alone in his house with him at night?$ Didn't his car bring you into town?$ Yes, but I...$ You...$ Stop that, Ida!$ Don't you try to defend her!$ All my life I've sweated and slaved, trying to make a decent woman out of her, to give her every advantage, and now look.$ Look how she repays me!$ How're we going to live?$ Where's the next dollar coming from?$ So that's all I mean to you!$ You're not worried about the scandal, it's just money!$ No one will hire me.$ RUTH:Bill!$ Ruth!$ Ruth!$ I'm sorry.$ You were drenched, and all in.$ I thought that...$ You don't have to apologize, Bill.$ You were ice-cold, and I couldn't bring you to.$ You'd better drink this now.$ I tried to give you some before, but it choked you.$ Are you all right now?$ But I thought I'd shake to pieces before I got up here.$ You probably staved off a grand case of flu.$ You shouldn't have tried to climb in this storm.$ I didn't care about the rain or anything.$ I just wanted to see you.$ You wanted to see me that much?$ Yes.$ Don't cry, Ruth, please.$ I can't help it.$ I never wanted to see anyone so much in all my life.$ I'm glad you feel that way.$ Ruth, it's been the same with me.$ I'm a clumsy ox around women.$ I don't know how to say it, but I've been in love with you for a long time.$ I wanted to tell you yesterday and lost my nerve.$ Last night I couldn't sleep thinking of you.$ I need you, Ruth.$ Are you going to laugh at me or marry me or cry some more?$ I'm going to do all three at once.$ Bill.$ Yes?$ Can we be married right away?$ Sure.We'll tell your family tonight.$ Ruth ought to be home by now.$ I'm worried, driving around in the rain.$ Worrying?$ Well, you better stop that right now.$ I've worried all my life, and you see all the thanks I get.$ I'm through.$ Annie!$ Of course I love you, Bill.$ MRS.

enough trouble, getting fired from the bank and having the whole town on her neck.$ Give her a break.She's engaged to be married.$ Why should you try and bust it up?$ CONNY:Somebody ought to do the sap a favor and tell him he's getting a second-hand bargain.$ I still hope that someday I'll have to pay for that cablegram.$ Goodbye, Romer.$ No, not goodbye.$ I hate goodbyes.$ What's the matter?$ Did he see me coming?$ What do you mean, Bill?$ Afraid of my finding out about you two?$ There's nothing to find out, Bill.$ Except that you got fired from the bank on account of him.$ Why did you lie to me if it wasn't true?$ Why were you anxious to leave the dance when you saw him coming?$ Well, I was panicky, Bill.$ I didn't want to see him.$ I was afraid that you would find out the things that people are saying about us and believe them.$ If it wasn't true, what did you have to be afraid of?$ I was afraid of losing you, Bill, and the only happiness I've ever known.$ So you tried to rush our marriage.$ Even your family tried to hurry us before I could find out.$ And you expect me to believe you!$ No, Bill, you've got to understand!$ Romer!$ I can't understand their being out all night.$ Well, thank heavens, she'll soon be married and all this worrying will be over with.$ Why, Bill!$ Will you ask Ruth if I can see her?$ Well, what's...$ Why, what's the matter, Bill?$ We quarreled last night, and I want to talk to her.Tell her I've got to talk to her.$ Well, Bill, she hasn't come down yet.$ I don't know, maybe she's still asleep.$ But I tell you, Bill, sit down here, and I'll go right up and see.$ Give him a cup of coffee, Pa.$ Sure.$ Hello, Mother.Where's Father?$ What are you trying to do, throw away your only chance of getting married?$ Coming in at this time of the

explaining later.$ I'll do all the explaining I'm going to do right now.$ Well, Bill?$ Ruth, I was a fool to say those things last night.$ It doesn't matter, now.$ Yes, it does.$ We can't let a quarrel like that stop our marriage.$ We'll be happy.$ You've got to forgive me.$ It isn't a case of my forgiving you now, Bill.$ The things you believed of me last night were lies, but this morning they're the truth.$ I spent last night at Romer's house.$ And you couldn't forgive that, could you?$ No, I didn't think you could.$ Never mind, Dad.$ I only came back to say goodbye.$ Why, where are you going?$ I don't know, but I'll write, Mother.$ Goodbye, Dad.$ Where to, Romer?$ New York.$ I owe a minister a bet there.$ What about?$ Well, he bet that someday I'd meet a girl I'd never want to lose and that he'd marry us.$ Say, did anyone ever tell you that your hair is...$ Is beautiful?$

You don't want to get very fresh with a girl you feel that about, do you?$ Like what, Jerry?$ What do you mean?$ Well, I...$ I want to know just how you feel.$ Well... it makes you something sort of special.$ Different from anything that's ever happened to me before.$ I don't mean that you're sugar and going to melt if it rains...$ But you might feel the same way about... an angel.$ if one happened along.$ In a way...$ I mean...$ Ask me questions.$ Maybe I can tell you.$ No, I don't need asking questions.$ You've already told me.$ If you'll take me out of this swamp of misery maybe I can tell you... really how I feel.$ How about it?$ I haven't been steering my course towards marriage very much...$ Right now, how about it?$ Right now...$ I'd black your boots for the rest of my life.$ What a girl, what an ocean.$ What a boat.$ Come here.$ Let me hear you say" I love you".$ I do, I do love you.$ No, like this:I love you, I love you.$ I love you.$ I love you, I love you.$ I love you.$ Come on.$ We'll dance until the sun comes up.$ And talk until it goes down again.$ Merry Christmas, everybody.$ Merry Christmas!$ Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...$ Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...$ Miss Lynton, Mr. Darrow, will you step this way just a minute, please.$ What are your plans, Miss Lynton?$ Are you gonna stay home awhile?$ Jerry, I don't know what to say.$ Just tell them everything's okay with you.$ I'm the happiest girl in the world.$ Can we get a picture, please?$ Step right up on the box, please.$ Up here?$ Yes, please, right up there.$ That's fine.$ This way, this way, Miss Lynton.$ Please, look this way.$ Miss Lynton, this way.$ Smile, please.$ That's fine.$ Thanks, Miss Lynton, very much.$ Did you do big game hunting there, Mr. Darrow?$ No.$ No?No.$ Oh, Miranda.$ Miranda, my ring.$ I must have let it in my room.$ I'll get it for you, darling.$ Never mind, I'll uh...$ I'll meet you among your trunks.$ All right, don't take too long.$ You didn't leave any ring.$ I know, but...$ I've just seen Renaul.$ You're dreaming.$ I wish I were.$ How did he get here?$ I don't know.$ He must have flown.$ Miranda...$ I've got to keep those two men from meeting.$ I don't know.$ Let's get out of here.$ I wonder what happens to my knees everytime I see that man.$ Why, Emile.$ This makes me a little dizzy.$ Am I dreaming you?$ No, you are not dreaming.$ I am very real.$ Very.$ Yes, I see you are.$ Come along.$ My trunks are over here.$ Now tell me all about it.$ I was afraid you might forget me if I gave you the chance.$ You didn't happen to fly over my ship, did you?$ I attempted to telephone.$ Really I did.$ Too bad you didn't.$ Oh, here they are.$ Foolish child.$ You can't keep away from me anywhere in the world.$ I'm afraid you're right.$ It isn't any cinch.$ You know, I pictured you waiting, absolutely sure I'd jump off that ship and swim back to you.$ Oh, do you mind.$ All my dutiable things are in this trunk.$ Now, is that all?$ Can we go?$ Okay, Miss Lynton.$ Thank you.$ Oh, I've got to stay and straighten all this mess out.$ I've also to go way over there and pay this.$ Unless you'd like to.$ I'd be delighted, of course.$ Where's my bag, Miranda?$ Never mind.Where's the place?$ This way, sir.$ I'm going.$ I'll see you at the house.$ Check those two to Grand Central Station for me, will you?$ Yes, sir.$ Hello, what kept you?$ I've been waiting for hours.$ We won't hesitate a minute, then.$ Let's go, my feet are frozen.$ Hello, Dennis.$ The car is right outside, Miss Lynton.$ Sure good to see you back.$ Thank you, Dennis.$ Where is Miss Letty?$ What's the matter with you?$ Where is she?$ Dennis, will you please take Mr. Darrow to his apartment and call him later to join me at dinner tonight.$ Are you sure your mother can wait until evening to meet me?$ I think it's better for you if she does.$ You're going to tell her you're leaving for the Adirondacks tonight.$ Yes, all that doesn't work will be over by dinnertime.$ I don't want to get off on the wrong foot.$ All right, see you later.$ It's gotta be 10 below zero up there, so you'd better bring your red flannel.$ There's some nice long red ones in my grandmother's trunk in the attic.$ I'll get them out.$ Hello, David.$ Miss Letty!$ Your mother is in her sitting room.$ It's good to see you, Miss Letty.$ Thanks, David.$ May I wish you great happiness, Miss Letty?$ What do you mean?$ The reporters have been phoning quite regularly.$ Oh... oh, dear.$ Well, here it goes.$ Hello, dear.$ I bought you a Christmas present.$ A little late, I'll admit, but... better late than never.$ David tells me the reporters have been bothering you.$ So you finally got home, didn't you?$ Sorry, dear, but I stopped to get this.$ Have you had a pleasant trip?$ You don't care a hang about that, do you?$ I'll open it by and by.$ Are you angry about my engagement?$ What difference does it make?$ You didn't wait to consult me.$ Mother...$ For this once I'm going to shoot point blank.$ Have you ever done anything else?$ Oh, I may have a lot of wild stuff from my father, but...$ I seem to have a lot of something else that I'm surprised to find.$ Perhaps I'm a little like you were years ago.$ I have never altered one iota.$ Oh, mother...$ Mother, won't you please try to listen to me just a minute.$ I mean, listen inside.$ I'm not the same girl that left you a year ago.$ Not the same girl at all.$ There were times when your father was very sweet and reasonable.$ But there never was a time when he wasn't deceiving me.$ I have schooled myself to get on without human affection.$ It's much too treacherous.$ Darling, do you think you're the only person in the world who's ever been hurt?$ My life is my own business.$ Oh, no, it isn't.$ There are so many things I could make up for.$ Oh, mother, I'm so much in love that...I could die for everything I've done that isn't right.$ I'd love to be able to look at myself and say...$ " You deserve to be happy."$ And I can be happy, mother.$ I love him so much that I'll breathe every breath for him for the rest of my life.$ So won't you try to be friends with me?Believe in me.$ It would help so much.$ Oh, this is very familiar.$ Oh, mother.$ Life is based on the truth, Letty.$ Whether you know it or not.$ I'd hate to be the man who depended on you.$ That's funny.$ You said something like that to me when I was 14 years old.$ Was it true or not?$ It wasn't true then.$ No, it wasn't true then.$ Oh, this isn't any good.$ You see, it's only that I need help and...$ Well, I don't know quite well where I'm going to get it.$ You know, mother,I think you're about the only person in the world who's never wanted to go the wrong way.$ Everyone else I know has at least a tendency.$ I have suffered all I am going to for other people's sins, Letty.$ Dear... when you figure it up like that$ there's nothing more to be said.$ Does she expect you?$ Yes, I'm quite sure she does.$ Ah, this way, sir.$ It's...$ That's all right, David.$ I'm not going to apologize, Emile.$ Quite simple, quite.$ You went off in a hurry because you didn't want me to meet this young man.$ Very simple.$ Oh, I'm sorry.$ I couldn't think of anything else.$ I couldn't trust you.$ I didn't know what you'd say.$ You're not going to be difficult, Emile.$ You're going to wish me every happiness, aren't you?$ I have come to congratulate you.$ Oh, have it your own way.$ All a really colossal joke.$ Merci.$ A magnificent joke.$ What's funny about it?$ I shall laugh at this days and nights for years to come.$ There's no joke about this.$ A voyage back to South America is pleasant, too.$ And we will take it together.$ You and I.$ Emile, I thought I told you before... that finishing was a habit of mine.$ But when you learned this habit you had not yet met me.$ Don't be absurd, Emile, there's nothing you can do.$ I don't come so far on a wild goose chase.$ The touch has lost all its magic.$ I've never in my life had anything happen that I hated, that I loathed like I do that.$ Well, we can't finish this here.$ You shall come tonight and tell me all about it.$ Oh, Emile, please.$ Please say goodbye and wish me luck.$ Oh, no.$ I know where you belong, Letty.$ This is the last time you'll ever see me.$ Until tonight, yes.$ Will you get out.$ If you don't I shall call the police.$ I'm not fooling about that.$ Good.$ We shall have some more interesting headlines.$ If by 8: 00 you are not at my hotel... by tomorrow you shall read in your own handwriting that you cannot live without Emile Renaul.$ Oh, but, you see, you're wrong.$ I've never done anything in my life that I haven't told him.$ You're lying.$ I'm not.$ I am not lying.$ If you hadn't, you wouldn't care if I met him on the docks.$ Anyhow, to speak of romantic past is one thing...$ Oh, not so loud, please.$ but letters which speak of long, lonely, heart-broken nights...$ Will you please be quiet.$ There's no woman in the world but you.$ There's no love for you but mine.$ Here's the number of my rooms.$ Eight o'clock.$ Oh, Miss Letty, what's the...$ Miranda, would you please get Mr. Darrow on the telephone.$ He's on the phone, Miss Letty, Mr. Darrow...$ Hello, Jerry.$ I can't leave for the Adirondacks tonight.$ Well, it's mother, you know.$ Yes, dear.$ I'll explain some other time.$ Sure, sure it's all right.$ I'm just trying to lie like a gentleman.$ No, of course it's all right.$ What's the difference on night more or less, when we're going to live the rest of our lives together?$ How much?$ I'll tell you how much.$ If I can't live the rest of my life with you...I don't want to live it at all.$ Oh, I mean that.$ Right.$ We'll leave for the Adirondacks in the morning.$ Yes, dear, with all my heart.$ Goodbye.$ You are late.$ I suppose you have been telling yourself you would not come.$ So?$ Sorry.$ Allow me.$ I've no idea of the time.$ What matters is you are here.$ My coat, please.$ Let me get thawed out.$ I'm paralyzed.$ Oh, and these.$ You won't need these again tonight.$ Oh, no?$ You are amusing.$ Any wine left?$ I'm congealed.$ There's nothing my Letty can want I shall not have for her.$ Not so?$ Oh, yes.$ No?$ Some food?$ Or are you fed?$ No, thanks, I'm not hungry.$ No?$ Sit down.$ Oh, caramba, this weather.$ Doesn't it make you want for Montevideo?$ How can you be so idiotic to think you are in love?$ Emile...$ I'm going to say something just as plainly as I possibly can.$ Very hard for you, plain speaking, isn't it?$ I'm too unhappy and too frightened to do anything else.$ Quite so.$ There shall be only one mind between us.$ Maybe you waste your time.$ The way I love you no other man can.$ Won't you please listen?$ Why listen?$ A woman was made for man's arms she likes the best.$ Nothing else will last till next Christmas.$ Emile... down there, the last time I saw you....$ I didn't think any more about love than you do.$ Women don't think.$ They change their minds, that's all.$ Have you any idea how I felt when you put your arms around me just now?$ I know how you felt...$ No, you don't.$ I felt just like putting a knife in your heart.$ How dare you say such things to me.$ How dare you.$ You're hurting me.$ We will discuss this thing at breakfast time.$ You will be more clear.$ Emile, you must listen to me.$ I want to get married.$ I've never loved anyone before in all my life.$ You or anybody else.$ I want you to give me my letters back.$ Let me have my chance, won't you, please?$ If you care the least little bit for me, you will.$ Emile, I'm begging.$ Begging for my life with all my heart.$ I know I don't deserve the chance, but...$ I'll make it if only you'd be a little kind.$ A man you have known for three weeks?$ You're making a laughing stock of me.$ When I awake, you are gone.$ Next time you leave me it will be when I have said so.$ Nothing can ever bring us again together, Emile, you and me, nothing under heaven.$ We are together, aren't we?$ And I doubt that you will scream or alarm the neighbors.$ Emile, I'm warning you...$ My dear child...$ I will have to see to it that life doesn't confuse you like this again.$ Yes?$ The waiter, sir.$ For the service.$ Later, please.$ I'm not finished.$ Well, this is fine.$ Once again, four walls, my Letty and me.$ That's the way it should be...$ You'll never put your hands on me again as long as I live.$ If I have to kill myself, you'll never do that.$ Oh, you will be true to Mr. Darrow, eh?$ Yes, I'll be true to him.$ No matter what you do.$ That's all I'm asking for, just a chance to prove it for the rest of my life.$ Where there isn't a rotten, filthy second I ever spent with you that I couldn't cut my heart out for.$ You dirty swine.$ How could I ever...$ How could you what?$ I don't know, but certain men you have had in your life...$ Get up here.$ No one has ever made a fool of me.$ Or ever will.$ Oh, you look as though you were interested in me once again.$ You see, you have exactly the same feeling for me as I have for you.$ So you would kill yourself.Because I take you in my arms, hm?$ Well?$ We shall leave on the first boat south.$ And I promise we shall have no more trouble ever again.$ Yes, we'll take the first boat south, no more trouble.$ My boat's in the harbor at Montevideo.$ We shall sail in the moonlight...$ Yes, sail in the moonlight...$ Music from the shore just for you and me...$ Yes, just for you and me.$ We shall dance, my Letty.$ Yes, we'll dance.$ Do you remember the last night down there?$ The tango?$ How glorious.$ We will dance again.$ Yes, yes, we'll dance.$ We'll dance$ Now life has some meaning.$ Now it has some flare.$ Oh, Emile, please.$ Please leave me just a minute to get myself together.$ I don't know quite what I'm doing.$ I'm not going to fight you, honestly I'm not, Emile.$ Won't you please let me be alone for just a minute?$ Please.$ Why is it so dark?$ Why is it so dark?$ What's the matter?$ Oh, you...$ You wished me to have it...$ Yes, I did it.$ I meant it for myself.$ Do you hear me?$ I meant it for myself.$ I'm glad I did it.$ You dirty, filthy, greedy mongrel.$ I'm glad I did it.$ If I hang for it, I'm glad I did it.$ Pardon me, sir.$ May I remove the service?$ To your health, sir.$ I thought I heard someone.$ I'm sorry, dear.$ I tried to come in as quietly as I could so I wouldn't wake you.$ You're not going to the Adirondacks tonight.$ No, tomorrow.$ Early?$ Yes, quite.$ Will you call me so that I can meet your fiancé?$ Yes.$ Yes, dear.$ It might have been the natural and polite thing to do if you had brought him in this evening.$ Several natural things might have happened this evening, mother, if you'd ever cared anything about me.$ It's too late for that now.$ Good night, dear.$ Hello, Jerry, my boy, welcome home.$ Jerry!$ I thought you'd never get here.$ You won't have to worry about your wandering boy any longer.$ Dad, I've learned a few foreign tricks so you get a great big kiss.$ Of course, this is Letty.$ There never was the chance of it being anybody else.$ Can you forgive us, my dear, for overlooking you for a minute?$ But, you see, he's all we have and he's been gone so long.$ Of course.$ And you've gathered by this time that this is Dad.$ And she may also have gathered that this is snow.$ Bring the poor girl in.$ You're very welcome, my dear.$ I tell you, old son, I've missed you.$ Well, it's great to be home.$ Hello, am I glad to see you.$ Nice to have you back.$ What about all those lies you used to tell me about lions, and tigers and panthers?$ Why don't you tell them about the panther that came in the upstairs window?$ You children must be freezing.$ Come along to the fireplace and have something hot.$ Jerry, I'm very cross with you.$ Ever since he was born I've been looking forward to anouncing his engagement.$ And here it was this morning all mixed up with my oatmeal.$ Did you read any of the cables he sent about you?$ Read them?$ Why, she told me what to say.$ I did not.$ It looks to me, son, you've done mighty well for yourself.$ You don't know the half of it.$ And a very good thing, too.$ And, if I may say so, you've done all right, too.$ Don't worry, Ive boosted myself plenty.$ Yes, siree.$ One of the best jobs I've done.$ You've done?$ Hm, it's nice and hot.$ Bring it along upstairs, dear.$ It's bound to be a lot of man talk.$ And, anyway, I want to get you all to myself.$ Fine girl, lad.$ She's great.$ We Darrows always had great luck with women.$ You like her?$ Fine.$ Has a chin.$ Good head.$ Doesn't gabble.$ Well-made.$ Congratulations, old man.$ Thanks.$ Oh, how nice and cosy.$ Yes.$ It is a cosy room.$ Look here, dear.$ These radiograms, all arranged in order.$ Number 1:$ Met a girl today named Letty.$ Second:$ Met a girl yesterday named Letty.$ He's so silly.$ As they go along we found out all about you.$ I put this here, dear, so that you'd see I was willing to hand him over to you.$ You mean share him with me.$ I hope you like us, Letty.$ So we can always be together.$ The four of us.$ You know...$ You're the sweetest thing I've ever known.$ We're the silly ones.$ I want to see Miss Lynton.$ Letty Lynton.$ Will you come in.$ What name shall I say?$ She don't know me.$ I'll tell Miss Lynton.$ Come here, dear.$ I want to show you a cheerful prospect for tomorrow.$ That pond is Darrow Lake.$ It's almost like they'd break my neck.$ Come in.$ A man to see Miss Lynton.$ Who is he?$ He wouldn't state his business, Miss.$ How mysterious.$ He seems to be a detective, Miss.$ My maid must have smuggled something in.$ I'll go right down and see about it.$ Can't be anything serious.$ Of course not.$ I'm terribly sorry.$ Oh, it'll be all right.$ I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I can't talk.$ Except to Miss Lynton.$ Oh, darling, you seem to be under arrest or something.$ What's all the excitement?$ Has Miranda been smuggling?$ Are you Miss Lynton?$ Yes.$ The District Attorney wants to see you, Miss.$ District Attorney?$ A man named Renaul was killed.$ It was in the paper this morning.$ Killed?$ You mean murdered?$ Now, just a few questions, Miss Lynton.$ But, you'll have to come with me now.$ You don't know anything about this.$ Of course, I don't.$ Where did this happen?$ At a hotel.$ New York?$ Yes.$ Did you know this man, Letty?$ Yes, I did, Mr. Darrow.$ But I left him in South America.$ It's murder.$ I wouldn't talk much.$ We'll have to start right away.$ Now, wait a minute...$ I'm sorry, sir. but its orders.$ Oh, what a shame.$ I'm awfully sorry.$ It's too bad.$ Do we have to stand for this just because she happened to know the man?$ I've got to do as I'm told, sir.$ I guess there's no use arguing.$ It's so embarrassing.$ There's nothing you can do about it.$ No, I guess not.$ I'll be right down.$ When did this happen?$ I haven't read the papers.$ Last night, about 10 o'clock.$ I'll have to go with her.$ Of course you will.$ Isn't it a shame, mother?$ Can you imagine anything as ridiculous as this?$ I'll be right with you.$ He's almost half an hour late already.$ He'll be here soon enough.$ Tired, darling?$ Oh, that long ride and no sleep.$ This won't last long.$ Mother, you've hardly spoken to me.$ Why?$ Because I'm in exactly the same position as the District Attorney.$ I'm waiting for this hearing.$ You're not afraid.$ I don't know.$ When you walk into this building, something seems to close in on you.$ Well, good morning.$ I'm frightfully sorry to have kept you waiting.$ I was unavoidably detained.$ I had to go to court for a second or two.$ You'll excuse me a moment.$ Send Baker in here.$ How unpleasant.$ There isn't a scrap of anything to connect you with this murder.$ Nice of you to come.$ I appreciate it.$ Tell Kingsley to take care of this.$ And Babson on the Renaul murder... get a hold of the Consul of whatever country that bird belonged to and find out all you can about him.$ A lot of that ground has been covered.$ Do it as I told you, tell Babson.$ And not a word to the press about this hearing.$ Why have you made such a point of getting my daughter here?$ We found out, Mrs. Lynton, that this man Renaul came north with your daughter in the same ship she did.$ Somebody's been kidding you, Mr. Haney.$ I was on that boat and he certainly was not.$ Well... what about this?$ We found that on the body of the dead man.$ Oh, I had forgotten about that.$ You see, he happened along as I was going through the customs and insisted upon taking care of it for me.$ Oh, I see, I see.$ Oh, this is Doctor Sanders who examined the body of the murdered man.$ Your name is Jerry Darrow, isn't it?$ Yes.$ Did you by any chance meet this man Renaul as he... just happened along at the customs?$ Why, er... no, I didn't.$ I suppose you have seen this.$ The headlines shout romance, but look at the picture.$ You see, the photographers asked her to get up on the rail and cross her legs.$ Well, was the shock as great as that?$ It's frightfully exaggerated.$ Cameras play funny tricks.$ What sort of a fellow was this man, Renaul?$ What do you mean?$ I mean, what did he do?$ He travelled, mostly.$ His business kept him 3 or 4 months out of every year in South America.$ Was he a wealthy man?$ I'm sure I don't know.$ He seemed to be.$ Sort of a man that might have enemies?$ I should think so, yes.$ You didn't, by any chance, happen to know any of the enemies he might have had.$ No, I don't remember any.$ I see.$ This must have just come.$ We wired the police down there to get a resumé of that man's life.$ How long were you there, Miss Lynton?$ Nearly three months.$ Indeed?$ Well I made a little foray to Rio and other places.$ Must have been having a pleasant time.$ Yes, I suppose I was.$ Renaul doing his share?$ He was very agreeable.$ You must have behaved yourself.$ The police make no mention of you.$ You left him at Montevideo?$ Yes, he came north by plane.$ Oh, then he was at the dock to meet you.$ Yes.$ Was that a surprise?$ Rather.$ I was wondering if the horror caught by this camera was just a surprise...$ You're trying to trap this girl, aren't you, Mr. Haney?$ Oh Lord, no, Mrs. Lynton.$ Just a habit.$ You see, one's brain gets to play over a case like a searchlight.$ Just a habit.$ When did you two meet?$ On board ship.$ Love at first sight?$ You see, we were three weeks coming from Montevideo.$ Did Renauld have the bad luck to fall in love with you, too?$ Yes, I guess he did.$ Don't you know he did?$ He did get to be a bit of a nuisance.$ He followed you north, didn't he?$ What if he did?$ That doesn't prove anything, does it?$ You'd been living with this man for months, hadn't you?$ I did nothing of the kind...$ Look here, sir, you can't get away with this.$ Just hold your horses, youngster.$ I feel sorry for you.$ We found these yesterday.$ In a box in the hotel office.$ Letters written by you.$ During one of these forays, as you call them.$ Miss Lynton, I must warn you that anything you say from now on may be used against you.$ It is my duty to turn you over to the police and hold you for the grand jury.$ Why?$ On what?$ Writing some foolish love letters?$ These are not foolish love letters.$ They speak very frankly and intelligently.$ Just listen to this one.$ Written in November, from Rio.$ Jerry, please let me fight this out alone.$ I thought so.$ She didn't want you to know... that these nights were agonies of loneliness for this romantic foreigner.$ here's another one.$ Don't make a fool of yourself, Haney.$ I know all about those letters, I know all about this situation.$ We're not living in the early 90s.$ You can tell that to the grand jury.$ You're not going to take this thing into court for nothing and make a laughing stock of yourself.$ You entered that man's rooms prepared to kill him or get these letters back, didn't you?$ I did nothing of the kind.$ I had no more idea of killing him than I had of killing my mother.$ But you did kill him.$ That's a lie.$ I did not.$ You went to this man's rooms at 10 o'clock, or thereabouts$ You asked for these, they were refused you.$ And then you killed him, you poisoned him.$ You're trying to force me into saying something that is not true.$ It is not true!In your haste to get away... you forgot something.$ All right, if you must have it.$ I did go to see him.$ I had told Jerry Darrow nothing.$ Don't you see I couldn't let him know what a rotten worthless thing I was because I might lose him.$ That's why I went to see Renaul.$ I told him that for the first time in my life I was in love.$ I begged him to give me a chance but he only laughed at me.$ I didn't go there to kill him.$ It never entered my mind.$ Wait a minute, Letty.$ There's no way out of this but the truth.$ At 8: 30 that night...I met Miss Lynton in the lobby of the hotel.$ We went to my apartment... and spent the night there.$ That's the truth.$ That's exactly what happened.$ Don't be a fool, Darrow.$ Right back at you, Mr. Haney.$ You're not bright enough to prove it.$ This girl could be at two places at the same time.$ If you want to take this thing into the court for the sheer pleasure of throwing mud on this girl, and her mother and my family wasting the public's money and making a fool of yourself...$ All right.$ You go ahead.$ I hope you can prove that when the time comes.$ At least it's the choice of evils.$ May I speak, Mr. Haney?$ Certainly, Mrs. Lynton, if you want to.$ I'd rather cut an arm off than verify the statement this young man has just made.$ But it's the truth.$ And I'd have to verify it if I went into court, wouldn't I?$ This is serious.$ Go ahead, Mrs. Lynton, tell me how you know this.$ On the afternoon of the day that this man was... this man died... he came to my house.$ I overheard a good deal of what he had to say.$ The man seemd to be quite mad.$ I heard him say... if my daughter did not come to his rooms by 8 o'clock that evening... he might kill himself before morning.$ The relationship between my daughter and myself for several years... has been wretched.$ She didn't come with her troubles to me.$ A little after 8 o'clockI went over to Renaul's hotel.$ I saw her leave with this young man.$ They walked over to Park Avenue.$ I saw them going to his place.$ I stood around in the street for, oh... probably an hour or so... trying to make up my mind what to do.$ Finally, in desperation, I followed them in.$ I begged of them not to begin life in this cheap miserable way.$ But they answered me exactly as this young man has just answered you.$ We are not living in the early 90s.$ So I came away.$ I stood in the street for quite a while and I saw the lights go out.$ Then I came home.$ Well...$ Mrs. Lynton, did anybody see you leave your house?$ Yes, sir, I did.$ It was about eight, sir.$ She came in just before midnight.$ Miss Lynton, would you go before a judge and a jury and swear to this?$ Would you swear to it?$ Why, I've told you the absolute truth.$ I'd have to, wouldn't I, Mr. Haney?$ The poison was administered about 10 o'clock, or thereabouts.$ Half an hour either way.$ Well...$ That's that.$ Miss Lynton...$ There are times when failure is not so hard to take.$ Believe me, this is one of those times.$ Mrs. Lynton, I wouldn't want to force you to go before a judge and a jury and have you tell them what you just told me.$ I'm convinced as you are.$ It would simply be a waste of time and public money.$ Mr. Darrow...$ I've got a girl just about her age.$ But she never yet has brought anybody around that can thinks as fast as you can, young fellow.$ I don't get you, Mr. Haney.$ Did you ever study law?$ No, why?$ Too bad.$ Lawyers with brains are scarce.$ Well, doctor, we may as well go.$ I haven't had my breakfast yet.$ Mother...$ I'm sorry we had to do that.$ Your mother and I.$ But we had to tell the truth.$ Jerry, you don't have to go any further.$ If there's another girl with this kind of stuff, I hope you get her.$ You deserve it.$ I hope you know why I did it.$ Goodbye.$ Try to forgive me.$ Breakfast is ready.$ Oh, Mrs. Lynton.$ Do you skate?$ I used to.$ I'd like to see Dad in the middle with you hanging on one arm and mother on the other.$ There will be a train about 12 o'clock.$ I'll wire them to meet us at the station with a sleigh.$

Oh, very well.$ - All right then.$ After you leave here, you're going to the British Museum to meet some friends of yours.$ You're going to ask them to join you in an expedition to go to the edge of the Gobi Desert and hunt for the lost and buried tomb of Genghis Khan.$ How the deuce did you know all that?$ It's my business to know things.$ Lionel, you must find that tomb.$ We can't allow for any failure, and you must be the first to find it.$ Why all the hurry?$ - You know Fu Manchu?$ - Yes.$ He's trying to find it, too.$ Oh, I didn't know he was an archaeologist.$ Oh, no, he's not.$ He's insane for power.$ - What do you expect to find in that tomb?$ - Records, the golden plate with the threat of Genghis Khan to return, the golden mask he wore and the famous golden scimitar.$ Exactly.$ Of course, in your hands, these things will be merely interesting archaeological specimens to go into the British Museum.$ But should Fu Manchu put that mask across his wicked eyes and take that scimitar into his bony, cruel hands, all Asia rises.$ He'll declare himself Genghis Khan come to life again, and he'll lead hundreds of millions of men to sweep the world.$ And that, my friend, is what you have got to prevent.$ You must find that grave.You must be the first to find it, and you must bring those pretty things back to England.$ Of course it's genuine.$ Don't you know that the Equus polydactylous, Anchitherium,$ Coryphodon, Equus sivalensis:$ But you forget, Equus asiaticus, Equus przewalskii,$ Equus lebii, Equus chenensis, Hipparion and...$ -

Terry.$ He found the slab.$ All right.$ Age before beauty.$ It's all right.Come on.$ Think of it, Sheila, we're the first to enter the tomb of the great Genghis Khan.$ It's overwhelming.$ I can hardly believe it.$ It just staggers my imagination.$ Aye, and you're standing in the first unplundered tomb of a king that died nearly 700 years ago.$ Look.$ Solid gold.$ Enough to pay a king's ransom.$ And sealed with the seal of Genghis Khan.$ Terry, give me your knife.$ Remember the curse on Tutankhamen's tomb?$ All the people connected with it died soon after its opening.$ That's a lot of bosh.$ Silly superstitions.$ They would have died...$ What's it say, Doctor?$ " May the curse of the Gods descend upon him$ " and his forever$ " who dares enter herein."$ I don't like to mar the beauty of these doors, but I have my orders.$ It's got to be done.$ -

Well, Mac.$ - Well, it's my old friend Smith.$ Nayland!$ This is a surprise.$ - Sir Nayland!$ - Hello, Terry.$ - He's looking fine, isn't he?$ - Yes.$ Oh, Nayland.What of my father?$ We'll talk about that later, Sheila.$ Take her in the house, Terrence.$ -

you?$ Packed and gone.$ Why?$ I don't have to tell you why.$ You mean because you didn't come home last night?$ Don't be silly.$ The way you talk, one would think we were living in my grandmother's day.$ No woman could forgive a man for doing what I did to you.$ It was my fault.$ Your fault?$ I opened the door and told you to go.$ You know, I wish you hadn't, Joan.$ You know, I think that you

rightly.$ Do you want me to go, Jerry?$ You'd be an awful fool if you stayed.$ No, I wouldn't.$ It happens I spent the morning realizing that we're living in a modern world where there's no place for old-fashioned wives.$ You seem to want a modern wife, and that's what I'm going to be.$ In other words, I'm going to unpack my trunks.$ You see, I'd rather go merrily to hell with you than alone.$ Joan, I always said you were swell.$ Perhaps you won't think so much longer, because if being a modern husband gives you privileges, then being a modern wife gives me privileges.$ I'm not worried, honey.$ I've told you before, you've got the words but not the tune.$ Don't forget, I have a musical ear and can pick up tunes easily.$ I'll have to hurry.$ Where are you going?$ I just made a

the reel to burn?$ That's good.$ Marvelous.$ Magnificent.$ Personally, I think it must be very difficult to be married to such an ardent young man.$ He thinks I'm swell.$ I do, darling.Isn't that what I always tell you?$ Jerry, you should be more expressive than that.$ He'll have every chance to be more expressive from now on!$ Joan.$ You're being rude to your guests, one in particular.$ I'd had an awful lot to drink, Joan.$ I'll never bring her here again.$ You can bring her here all you want.$ Besides, we did have an agreement not to be jealous of each other.$ My grandmother would have thought that a very silly agreement, and I've discovered she would have been right.$ Besides, I can't be jealous of someone I've never really had.$ I mean you.$ Now, that isn't true.$ It is true.$ Except for a short while after we were married.$ You started drinking because of Claire Hempstead.$ Well, that's true enough.$ And you started drinking again when you met her again.$ I stayed with you because I thought you had loved me and would again.$ Now I know you never did because you married me with her image in your mind.$ In all the time we've been together, you've never once said," I love you."$ You'll never know how much I've wanted to hear you say that.$ Yes, and there's something else I've been trying to tell you all evening, and now you'll never know.$ Joan, you're crazy.$ You know that I think you're... if you say that word to me once more, I think I'll kill you!$ Where you going?$ I'm going to my father, who's always loved me.$ I'm going with you.$ The one thing you can do for me is to stay just where you are.$ Joan.$ Joan!$ I'm going.$ Good night, old man.$ Good night.$ Good night, Jerry.$ Good night.$ She's gone.$ That's the best thing she ever...$ MAN 1:Be up to your place

ever got me into it.$ You do need a drink.Here.$ You've fed me enough liquor.$ What's happened to you?$ Something you wouldn't understand.$ Just a few words that Joan said to me, enough to make me understand why I drink, and you can't realize how knowing that gives me a weapon against it.$ The only thing worse than a drunkard is a reformed drunkard.$ Be yourself, Jerry.$ I am myself for the first time.$ That's why you don't recognize me.$ That's why you don't understand that I don't want ever to see you again.$ Ever, as long as you live, do you hear?Yes, I hear.$ In fact, my organs of hearing are very good.$ In other words, don't shout at me.$ Well, I feel like shouting.$ I want you to know just where I stand with myself.$ I'm not interested.$ And I want you to know just where you stand with me.$ You don't mean a thing to me, and the funny thing is, I never knew it until a few moments ago.$ You should have been grateful to find it out.$ I am grateful.$ Yes, I'm grateful this

wonderful reality in my arms.$ You really should save those speeches for your plays.$ Good night.Yes, see you later.$ Good night.$ What this country needs is fewer blondes.$ Is that so?$ We got them

3136940$ The channel's here on the chart.$ So are the marking lights.$ Then what's wrong with them?$ Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.They're both a bit out of position, according to this.$ Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over.$ " Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.$ You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.$ Have any of you seen the captain today?$ - No.$ He wasn't down for dinner.$ - No, and he wasn't down for lunch.He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.$ What are you driving at?$ Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.$ There's something wrong.$ Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.$ Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?$ - Give him a shot of scotch.$ - Give the whole bottle.$ - No!I've got nerves too.$ - Here you are, Doc.$ Just what you need.$ - Well, maybe you're right.$ - Good evening, Captain.$ - Good evening, sir.$ - May I speak with you?$ - Why, certainly.$ Go ahead.We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.$ - Good.$ - But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.$ The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific.$ You know that.$ I know, sir, but...Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?$ - Well, not a lot.$ - Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...$ Bob's not a sailor.$ He's a hunter.He's made many of these trips.$ He's young, but he has judgment.$ I'll call him.$ - Oh, Bob.$ Bob!$ - What is it?- Come up here, will ya?$ - Just a minute.$ What's bothering you, Captain?$ There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.$ Boy!Just take a look at these.$ You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter, Doc, but oh, what a photographer.$ If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.$ If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.$ Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper.$ What's the matter?These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.$ I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.$ Well, what do you think, fellas?$ I think we should turn back and take the outside course.$ We'll go ahead.$ Very well, sir.$ " It was the schooner' Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea."$ Now, wait a minute, fellas.$ Let's talk this over.- There's no use taking any chances.$ - Chances?$ That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.$ Get an eyeful of this.$ And he talks about taking chances.$ Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.$ Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.$ He looks more frightened than the tiger.$ - What'd you have on your mind, Doc?$ I'll tell you what I had on my mind.$ I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.$ The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.$ - Hear!$ Hear!- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?$ Now, just a minute.$ What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?$ Take that fellow right there, for instance.There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.$ He didn't want to.He got interested in hunting me.$ He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.$ As a matter of fact, we admired each other.$ Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?$ - Well, not now.$ - Mm-mm!Here comes that bad-luck lady again.$ Third time tonight.$ Let me shuffle them.- Wait a minute.$ - Yeah, speak up.$ - I asked you a question.$ - You did?$ I forgot.- Oh, no, you didn't.$ I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.$ - What's your answer now, Bob?That's something I'll never have to decide.$ Listen here, you fellows.$ This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.$ Luckily, I'm a hunter.Nothing can ever change that.$ Hang on!$ Hello!Hello, down there!Hello, Engine Room!$ - The panel is flooded!$ - If the water hits those hot boilers...$ You trying to drown me?$ Where are the others?$ See anybody?$ Nobody left but us two and...$ Doc!$ - Look!- Shark!$ Ohh!It got me!$ Hello!Is anybody here?$ Anybody around, I say.$ Oh, hello.$ Is this your house?$ I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.$ Our yacht just sunk with all hands.$ I got ashore and found your place here by accident.$ I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.$ Don't you understand any English?$ Ivan does not speak any language.$ He has the misfortune to be dumb.$ Oh, hello.$ Are you the owner here?Yes.$ Welcome to my poor fortress.$ - Fortress?$ - It once was.$ Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.$ I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.$ I am Count Zaroff.$ My name's Robert Rainsford.$ Glad to meet you.$ Very glad.$ Ivan is a Cossack.$ I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.$ Smile, Ivan.$ I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.$ But how appalling!$ And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?$ Yes, I'm afraid I am.$ You're certain?$ I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.$ The swellest crowd on Earth...my best friends.$ - It's incredible.$ - Such things are always incredible.$ Death is for others, not for ourselves.$ That is how most of my other guests have felt.$ Your other guests?You mean this has happened before?$ My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.$ It would seem that this island were cursed.$ That's just what the captain said.Only he thought it was uninhabited.$ We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.$ - Well, it's a break for me, anyway.$ - My house is yours.$ Oh, by the way.You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.Yes.$ They look about the way I feel.Yes.$ I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.$ Ivan will show you to your room.- Thank you.$ - You'll find a stiff drink there also.$ Thanks a lot.$ All pleasure is mine.$ Come in.$ - Ready, Rainsford?- All set.$ I'm afraid we have finished dinner.But I have ordered something for you.Thanks.$ I don't feel like eating, though.Oh.$ Well, perhaps later.$ Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company?$ It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.$ If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.A-Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.- Why, sure.$ Of course.- Thank you.$ Miss Trowbridge, may I present Mr. Robert Rainsford.$ - Miss Eve Trowbridge.$ - How do you do?- How do you do?$ - And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.$ How are you, old chap?Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?$ - Coming out of it now, thanks.$ - We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?$ Indeed we do.$ Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.Oh, yes, of course.$ Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.$ Vodka, that's the stuff!$ One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.$ Have to toss it off, though.Like this.$ Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?$ Don't be ridiculous, sis.$ We are victims of circumstance.Same as Mr. Rainsford.$ And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.- Isn't that so, Count?$ - Of course, yes.$ - You were in a shipwreck too?$ Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.$ The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.$ Those channel lights must have been shifted.$ - I wonder it hasn't been reported.$ - Well, we'll report' em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.$ You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.$ Russians are not the best mechanics.$ I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.It's all right with me.$ I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.$ Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.$ Just sketchily, you know...$ born, married, why I left my last job.$ No, no, no, no.One moment, please.$ Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.$ We entertain a celebrity, Miss Trowbridge.$ Wait a minute, wait a minute.Don't tell me.Let me guess.$ I know.Flagpole sitter.$ He wrote some books.$ - No, he lived some books.$ If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.Yeah?$ Here's to ya.$ - I've lugged a gun around a little.$ -" I've lugged a gun around a little."$ No, I have read your books.$ I read all books on hunting.$ - A papiroso?$ - Thank you.$ Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.- What do you mean," sane"?$ - Cigarette?$ - Hmm?Yeah.Thanks.$ - You do not excuse what needs no excuse.$ How did you put it?$ " Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher."$ - You have put our case perfectly.- Then you're a hunter yourself?$ We are kindred spirits.$ It is my one passion.$ He sleeps all day and hunts all night.$ And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.$ We'll have capital sport together, I hope.$ Don't encourage him.$ He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.$ But what do you hunt here?$ I'll tell you.$ You will be amused, I know.$ I have done a rare thing.$ I have invented a new sensation.$ Yeah, and is he stingy with it.$ What is this sensation, Count?$ Mr. Rainsford, God made some men poets.$ Some He made kings, some beggars.$ Me, He made a hunter.$ My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.$ He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.$ When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.$ - Good for him.$ - My life has been one glorious hunt.$ It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.$ - But when the revolution...$ - Look out.$ Oh, I'm so sorry.$ Count Zaroff was so interesting...I didn't realize the danger.$ Oh, it's all right now.What were you saying about the revolution, Count?$ Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.$ Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.$ It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.$ That must have been a close call.Yes.$ It still bothers me sometimes.$ However, in two months I was on my way to the Amazon.$ I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.$ No, no, no.No sport at all.$ Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.$ One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.$ Hunting was beginning to bore me.$ Is that such a terrible thought, Count?$ It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.$ When I lost my love of hunting...I lost my love of life...of love.$ Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.$ I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.$ I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.$ Tartar which?$ Tartar war bow...$ That one up there.$ It's cute.$ Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.$ What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.$ - A new animal?$ - Exactly so.$ You found one?$ Yes.$ Here on my island...$ I hunt the most dangerous game.$ " The most dangerous game"?$ You mean tigers?$ Tigers?No.$ The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.$ I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water.$ Was that it?$ It's no use, Rainsford.$ He won't tell.$ He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.$ My one secret.$ I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.$ You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you I go for it.$ You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.$ If he says a thing is good, it is good.$ He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano...anything you want.$ He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?$ Yes, yes.$ You want me to go hunting?$ You just say the word.We're pals.$ We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.$ A completely civilized point of view.$ I tell you what you do.$ You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.$ We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip... and the guides will make the deers behave.$ I think we'd better change the subject.$ All right.$ Change the subject.Oh, I know!$ Play the piano, huh?$ If you wish.$ Good idea.Play the piano.$ Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.$ Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.$ There you go, sis, throwing cold water.Leave me alone.$ I know where the piano is.$ I'm perfectly sober.$ Charming simplicity.$ " Completely civilized," did you say?$ He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.$ We barbarians know that it is after the chase... and then only that man revels.$ It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.Of course, yes.$ You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains...$ " Hunt first the enemy, then the woman."$ That's the savages' idea everywhere.$ It is the natural instinct.$ What is woman...even such a woman as this... until the blood is quickened by the kill?$ - Oh, I don't know.$ -" Oh, I don't know."$ You Americans.$ One passion builds upon another.$ Kill!Then love.$ When you have known that... you will have known ecstasy.$ Oh, Martin!$ Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king... in his Branca Island hour.$ Come on, Count.Now, you show them.$ - What do you suggest?$ - Oh, just a good tune.$ But not highbrow, like last night.$ - Just a good tune, see?- I see.$ Oh, his hunting dogs.Keep your voice low and listen.$ It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.$ I heard it leave the boathouse last night.It returned this morning.$ You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?Yes.$ Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.$ Two, maybe.$ There were four of us a week ago.$ - The other two have disappeared.$ - What do you mean?$ One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors... down to see his trophy room... at the foot of those stone steps.$ - That iron door?- Yes.$ Two nights later he took the other there.$ Neither has been seen since.$ Have you asked him about them?He says they've gone hunting.$ Oh, be careful.$ He's watching us.$ Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?Now look here.$ You must be mistaken.$ Not now.$ Applaud.$ Attaboy!- Thank you.$ What did I tell you?$ Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?$ It was splendid.$ Don't stop, please.$ I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience.$ Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford... to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.$ My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.$ I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.$ Excuse me.$ You know, the count's worse than a family governess.$ Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.$ Oh, no, my dear.No.$ Charming children.$ There, you hear that, sis?$ Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.$ Well, after that I guess...I guess I'll have to go.$ - Good night, Mr. Rainsford.- Good night.$ We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.$ - Good night.$ Good night, sis.$ We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.$ Oh, my dear Rainsford, I have been most inconsiderate.$ You must be feeling the need of sleep too.$ - Yes, I am just about all in.$ - Then Ivan will show you to your room.$ Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?Don't worry.$ The count'll take care of me, all right.$ Indeed I shall.$ - Well, good night.$ - Good night, sir.$ Sleep well.$ Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.$ A long life.$ Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge... are you also fatigued?$ Tired?Me?$ You know I'm not.$ You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.$ Up all night and sleep all day.$ Well, good night.$ Well, what are we gonna do, huh?$ What's the big idea?$ I thought that perhaps... tonight you would like to see my trophy room?$ Your trophy room?$ I'm sure you will find it most... interesting.$ Say, that's a great idea.Ho-ho.$ Now we're pals.No more secrets now, huh?$ - We'll make a night of it.$ - I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.$ Just you and I... pals.We'll have fun together, huh?$ Precisely, yes.$ Fun together.$ Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.$ Please let me come in.$ I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.$ - What was it?Those dogs?$ - My brother.$ I've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs.$ I've just gone to his room.He isn't there!$ - He's probably somewhere with the count.$ - That's just what I'm afraid of.$ Count Zaroff is planning something...about my brother and me.$ You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?$ Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him.$ Won't you help me?$ Why, of course I'll help you.$ - Where do you think he's gone?$ - Where did the others go?$ The iron door.$ I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.$ Thank you.$ That's queer.It's unlocked.$ Zaroff!He's coming down.$ Back here, quick!$ Where is my brother?$ Where is my brother?$ You killed him!$ You killed my brother!$ You!$ Come, come, my dear Rainsford.$ I don't want to treat you like my other guests.$ You and I, we are hunters.$ So that's your most dangerous game.Yes.$ My dear fellow, I intended to tell you last night... but you know, Miss Trowbridge...$ You hunted him like an animal.$ I know what you think, but you are wrong.$ He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out.$ An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses.$ You raving maniac!$ Yes, yes, yes.I'll take it off...when we've finished.$ The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow.$ You see, when I first began stocking my island... many of my guests thought I was joking... so I established this trophy room.$ I always bring them here before the hunt.$ An hour with my trophies... and they usually do their best to keep away from me.$ Where do you get these poor devils?$ Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.$ But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel.$ They do not always mark it.$ - You shifted them.$ - Precisely right.$ Too bad your yacht should have suffered... but at least it brought us together.$ You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked... and drive them out to be hunted.$ I give them every consideration... good food, exercise... everything to get them in splendid shape.$ - To be shot down in cold blood.$ - Oh, no, no.$ Oh, I admit, with this annoying fellow... but usually I give them hunting clothes... a woodsman's knife and a full day's start.$ I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.$ And if one eludes me only till sunrise... he wins the game.$ Suppose he refuses to be hunted.$ Ivan is such an artist with these.Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.$ And when they win?$ To date I have not lost.$ Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing.$ When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.$ You murdering rat!$ I'm a hunter not an assassin.$ Come, Rainsford.Say you will hunt with me.$ Hunt men?$ Say you will hunt with me!$ No?$ What do you think I am?$ One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions... to their logical conclusion.$ I'm afraid in this instance, Mr. Rainsford... you may have to follow them.$ What do you mean?$ I shall not wait for the next ship.$ Four o'clock.$ The sun is just rising.$ Come, Mr. Rainsford.Let us not waste time.$ Your fangs and claws, Mr. Rainsford.$ Ivan.$ Bob, what are they going to do?$ - I'm going to be hunted.- Oh, no.$ No, Miss Trowbridge.$ Outdoor chess.$ His brain against mine.$ His good craft against mine.$ - And the prize?$ - The prize?$ You may recall what I said last evening.$ Only after the kill... does man know the true ecstasy of love.$ Suppose you lose.$ If I do not...What shall I say?...$ - I'm going with you.$ - No.He'll kill you too.$ Not at all.$ One does not kill a female animal.$ If you lose, I can easily recapture her alive.$ I'll take her with me then.$ We'll set him a trail he'll remember.$ It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.$ Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.$ Don't lose your nerve.We'll beat this thing.$ - The others didn't.$ - We will.$ Come on.Let's get going.$ It seems as though we've come miles.$ Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.$ Let's keep going.$ Come on.$ Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.$ We'll soon be safe.$ No wonder he was so sure.$ This island is no bigger than a deer park.$ Oh, Bob!$ Come on, now.$ What are we going to do?$ We didn't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us.$ I shouldn't have come with you.$ You might beat him if you were alone.$ Alone?$ And leave you here with that savage?$ Not a chance.$ Now we've got to think of something to worry him.$ You'd never get near him.He'd shoot on sight.$ Weapons aren't everything in the jungle.$ Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?$ - The one we just passed?- Yes.$ I want to show you something.$ You see?$ If that supporting branch were cut away... this fallen tree would make a perfect Malay deadfall.$ A Malay deadfall?$ What's that?$ A man-killing contraption the natives use.$ It would stop that madman, all right.$ Trouble is, it takes quite a few hours to build.$ He said he wouldn't follow till midnight.That's right.$ If you help me, I think we'll have time.$ We'll cut some strong vines.$ There.$ Almost ready.$ This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.$ He'll have been on his way almost an hour now.$ Look out!$ Don't touch that trip line.You'll have a two-ton tree down on your back.$ - Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.$ - Will it really work?$ I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.$ Look here.You touch that trip line... it'll pull that trigger free.Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.$ It'll crash down and kill anything underneath it.$ Look.$ We're ready.$ Let him come.$ Give me that knife.$ Come out, Rainsford.$ Why prolong it?$ I'll not bungle this shot.$ You'll never even feel it.$ But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards... would follow you into that ambush?$ Oh, very well.If you choose to play the leopard...I shall hunt you like a leopard.$ Wait.Maybe it's a trick.$ Eve.$ Why did he go?$ He's playing with us...like a cat with a mouse.$ What do you mean?$ You heard him say he'd hunt us as he'd hunt a leopard.$ That means he's gone for his high-powered rifle.$ His rifle?$ Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!$ - Run, quick!- Eve, wait.$ - No, I tell you, no!$ - Don't stop!No!$ Wait.$ That's Fog Hollow ahead.- Fog Hollow?$ - The swamp where he caught the others.$ We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.$ - But there's no place else to run.$ - That's just what he's counting on.$ We've got two hours till dawn.$ We've got to use our brains instead of our legs.$ But he'll have his rifle.$ And we'll have a man trap.$ It makes me dizzy.$ Cover this over.$ When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting.$ Quick.Gather some leaves and grass.I'll cut some branches.$ Yes.$ Very good, Rainsford.Very good.$ You have not won yet.$ Look at your watch.$ Are you looking at it?$ Still half an hour till sunrise.$ Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.$ As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.$ You have made my rifle useless in the fog.$ You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.$ Those animals I cornered...$ now I know how they felt.$ Achmed, Miss Trowbridge... bring her here.$ Now!$ My dear Rainsford, I congratulate you.$ You have beaten me.$ Not yet.$ Oh, but of course.$ Why, you're...You're not even wounded.$ You hit the dog not me.$ I took a chance and went over with him.$ A clever trick, Rainsford.$ I cheerfully admit defeat.$ Here's the key of the boathouse.$ The door is in the trophy room.$ You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once.$ Eve!$ The boat!$ 
5998313$ Trying to teach me a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?$ Method is everything in archeology, my boy.$ We always deal with our finds of the day in order.$ Well, it seems to me that that box we dug up today, with the very peculiar gentleman, over there, is the only find we've made in the past two months that'll bring this expedition any medals from the British Museum.$ We didn't come to dig in Egypt for medals.$ Much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds.$ Our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past, not to satisfy our own curiosity.$ That's all very true, Sir Joseph, but after all, we're human.$ And a find like this...$ Well, how can you wait?This is your first trip.$ I've been out here 10 years, and I'm more curious about that mummy than you are, and even more about that box.$ Whemple.$ Yes?$ The viscera were not removed.$ The usual scar made by the embalmer's knife is not there.$ I guessed as much, Muller.$ I had a good look at him when I photographed him.$ Never saw a mummy like that.$ Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.$ Looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner.$ The contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages.$ Buried alive.$ " Imhotep,$ " High Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak."$ Poor old fellow.$ Now, what could you have done to make them treat you like that?$ An execution for treason, I suppose.$ Sacrilege, more likely.$ Look.The sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off of the coffin.$ So Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world, but in the next.$ Maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple.$ Possibly.$ The priestesses of the Temple of Karnak were the daughters of the reigning pharaohs.$ They were the sacred virgins of Isis.$ Maybe the answer's in that box we found buried with him.$ I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it's open.$ Come on.$ The wood's so rotten, it'll fall apart at a touch.$ Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.$ Metal.$ Looks like copper.$ It's gold.$ I say!$ Look here.$ The unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis.$ Some temple treasure.$ " Death, eternal punishment" for anyone" who opens this casket,$ " in the name of Amon-Ra," the King of the Gods."$ Good heavens!What a terrible curse!$ Well, let's see what's inside.$ Wait!You have read the curse.$ We recognize your mastery of the occult sciences, Muller, but I can't permit your beliefs to interfere with my work.$ Then why did you send for me this afternoon?$ As a friend and an expert.$ Because I saw this find was unique, and I wanted your opinion on it.$ It is providential that you did.$ Come, Dr. Muller.$ Surely a few thousand years in the earth would take the mumbo-jumbo off any old curse.$ I cannot speak before a boy.$ Come out under the stars of Egypt.$ Do not touch that casket.$ Go on with your cataloging.$ We'll open it later.$ You needn't think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here.$ If you're right about the legend, then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth from the holy of holies in the temple.And I can hardly wait to get back to find out.$ The gods of Egypt still live in these hills, in their ruined temples.$ The ancient spells are weaker, but some of them are still potent, and I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself, which contains the great spell by which Isis raised Osiris from the dead.$ Put it back.$ Bury it where you found it.$ You have read the curse.$ You dare defy it?$ In the interest of science, even if I believed in the curse,I'd go on with my work for the museum.$ Come back with me, and we'll examine this great find together.$ I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence.$ What's the matter, man?$ For heaven's sake, what is it?$ He...He went for a little walk.$ You should have seen his face.$ Here's something to break the monotony.$ There's a visitor coming up the trail from the Nile.$ Color?$ Nationality?$ How could I see in that glare?$ Well, Whemple, back we go to London.$ And what fools we look.$ Money wasted.Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.$ A few beads, a few broken pots.$ A man needs more than hard work for this game.$ He needs flair.$ He needs luck, like your father.$ In the days when he used to come out here, there wasn't so much competition.$ When he did, he found things.$ And once, 10 years ago, he found too much.$ Was it 10 years ago?$ Queer story, that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad.$ You know what I think it was?$ No.What?$ I think he went crazy, bored beyond human endurance, messing around in this sand and these rocks.$ He was laughing when your father found him.$ He died laughing, in a straitjacket.$ Your father never explained.$ But when the best excavator England has turned out, a man who loved Egypt, said he'd never come back here, that meant something.$ Come in.$ You break your season's camp, Professor Pearson?$ Your colleagues have returned to London?$ Yes.$ Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up.$ Your expedition has not been a success.$ Scarcely.$ Here are the season's finds.$ Permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen.$ This is very sporting of you.$ May I ask why?We Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead.$ Only foreign museums.$ Well, what's this?$ Part of the funerary equipment of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon, daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.$ Yes.$ It's her name.$ I found that not 100 yards from where we are.$ You mean, you think her tomb is there?$ I will show you where to dig.$ I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...$ I didn't catch your name.$ Ardeth Bay.$ Circumstantial evidence.$ Not very strong, perhaps, but if we put that gang of diggers from Kerna on the job, we can tell in two days if there's anything here.$ In one day, Professor.$ It's a step!$ He was right.$ Anyhow, we found something.$ The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.$ We will cable your father in London.$ He must be here when we examine this great find.$ The seal of the seven jackals.$ And it's unbroken.$ No one has entered this door since the priests of the royal necropolis sealed it.$ 3,700 years ago.$ Is there a view like this in all the world, Helen?$ The real Egypt.$ Are we really in this dreadful, modern Cairo?$ Your thoughts are far away from the dance and these nice English boys, my dear.$ Not really.$ I'm having a lovely time.$ I'm so grateful.$ But why?$ For your keeping me here with you, of course.$ So I don't have to go up to Father in that beastly hot Sudan.$ It's I who am grateful, my most interesting patient.$ Know who that is?$ Muller of Vienna.$ Really?$ Always spends his winters here.$ Authority on the Egyptian occult.$ Yes, but the girl.$ Helen Grosvenor.$ Her father's Governor of the Sudan.$ English, of course.$ Her mother, Egyptian.$ Some old family with a tree a mile long.$ She's staying here with Dr. and Mrs. Muller.$ Pardon me, sir.$ Our closing bell has rung.$ I did not notice the time.$ I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?$ Yes.$ I am Ardeth Bay.$ Indeed!$ Why, we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all.$ The museum should be kept open all night in your honor.$ Won't you come down to my office?$ I'm working here late.$ Your pardon.$ I dislike to be touched.$ An Eastern prejudice.$ Won't you sit down?$ You know my son.$ Ardeth Bay.Where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb?$ I returned to Cairo.$ But...But now I must not detain you.$ But I must see you again.$ You...You must come to my house.$ I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations.$ He's a strange one.$ But you might at least have thanked the man.$ He was responsible for finding the princess.$ Yes.I rather wish he hadn't been.$ I think it's a dirty trick, this Cairo Museum keeping everything we've found.$ That was the contract.$ The British Museum works for the cause of science, not for loot.$ Anck-es-en-Amon.$ Is anything the matter?$ Anck-es-en-Amon.$ Where do you want to go, miss?$ Le Musée des Antiquités.$ Imhotep.$ Anck-es-en-Amon.$ Anck-es-en-Amon.Imhotep.$ I must get in.$ Anck-es-en-Amon.I must.$ It's closed for the night.$ Everybody's gone home.$ I must get in.$ Imhotep.Imhotep.$ What's she saying?$ What language is that?$ The language of Ancient Egypt, not heard on this earth for 2,000 years.$ And the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy.$ Is your master at home?$ Yes, efendi.$ Tell him Dr. Muller wishes to see him, urgently.$ How did I get here?$ We brought you here.Father and I.$ You fainted.$ But how did you guess she was here?$ I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum.$ I went there.The watchman said she had left in your car.$ Before you take her away, I must talk to you about something she said just now.$ Oh, Dr. Muller.$ So, here you are, my dear.$ I suppose you introduced yourself.$ No?$ Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.$ This seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances.$ And now, if you're all right again, back we go to the hotel.$ I...I think she ought to rest a few minutes.$ Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?$ Well...$ Where was I when I fainted, Mr. Whemple?$ Oh, outside the museum.$ What was I doing there?$ Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?$ No, I don't suppose you would.$ I wish I did.$ You see, I was waiting...$ Let's not talk about it.$ Oh, right.$ You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?Yes.$ How did you guess that?$ Oh, I don't know.$ Just something about you.$ You know, I'd have liked Egypt better if I'd met you there, but no such luck.$ Stuck in the desert for two months, and was it hot!$ That tomb!$ What tomb?$ Surely you read about the princess.$ So you did that.$ Yes.The 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling.$ But when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things...$ You know, they buried everything with them that they used in life.$ Well, when we came to unwrap the girl herself...$ How could you do that?$ Had to.$ Science, you know.$ Well, after we'd worked among her things, I felt as if I'd known her.$ And when we got the wrappings off, and I saw her face...$ You'll think me silly, but I sort of fell in love with her.$ Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with?$ I say!$ Now I know what it is about you.$ There was something about her head...$ I had never mentioned the name, yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter, in ancient Egyptian, something about Imhotep.$ Imhotep?$ What was this Ardeth doing in the museum?$ Looking at the mummy, just at closing time.$ Hello.$ What?$ Come.A museum guard found dead in the room of the princess.$ So he died of shock.$ We find this in dead guard's hand, Sir Joseph.$ Probably thief try to steal it.$ Guard take it away, thief kill him.$ The cause of death, I not find nothing.$ Looks like an attempted theft, but nothing stolen here could be disposed of.$ What is the document?$ Let me put this here.$ You'll be more comfortable.$ Thanks.$ You really want to know why I didn't take you to the hospital?$ Because when I held you in my arms...$ Hadn't you better not commit yourself?$ What girl could fail to make a conquest who collapsed at a man's feet in the moonlight?$ Oh, I know it seems absurd when we've known each other such a short time, but I'm serious.$ Don't you think I've had enough excitement for one evening, without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me?$ But I've never been serious about this sort of thing before.$ Now, look here.$ You can tell me to go to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.$ The curse has struck her, and now, through her, it will strike my son.$ Quiet.$ Frank, will you come to your father's study?$ Helen, I shall take you home presently.$ I'll be back in a minute.$ Imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple.$ Thirty-seven hundred years ago!$ What's that got to do with us, now?$ Your assistant, who went insane and died, as you might have done if you'd seen what he saw, made a transcription of part of that scroll.$ Yes.$ I have it still.$ You seem to think this thing has all the devils of Hell in it.$ Why not burn it and be done with it?$ An excellent suggestion.$ What became of the mummy of Imhotep?$ Somebody stole it.$ Look here, Dr. Muller.What's the matter with Miss Grosvenor?$ You still think that that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?$ Yes, I...$ Oh, I don't know.$ A thousand pardons.$ I am Ardeth Bay.$ I'm Helen Grosvenor.$ I called to see Sir Joseph.$ He's in the study.$ A conference?$ If I might perhaps wait.$ Yes.$ Of course.$ Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?$ No, I don't think so.$ I don't think one would forget meeting you, Ardeth Bay.$ Then I am mistaken.$ But you are of our blood.$ As to that, I am not mistaken.$ Yes.$ My mother was Egyptian.$ You must burn the Scroll of Thoth.$ I tell you, it's the museum's property, not mine.$ Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?$ Ardeth Bay.$ He's come for the scroll.$ Ardeth Bay, Dr. Muller.$ I accept your invitation, but I find no solitary student with his books.$ I fear my visit is inopportune.$ On the contrary, we were just talking about...$ Me?$ Your native Egypt.$ You know Miss Grosvenor?$ Ardeth Bay introduced himself.$ Won't you be seated?$ Sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.$ Partly inference, partly chance.$ Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.$ Yes.$ A tragedy at the museum after you left.$ Tragedy?$ When I was there?$ When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?$ Yes.$ They told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed.$ I don't remember, but...$ Helen, it is very late.$ Frank, will you please see Helen back to the hotel?$ Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.$ But I don't want to go.$ After what happened, you need rest badly.$ But I don't.$ I was tired, but I...$ Why, I've never felt so alive before.$ Then as your doctor, I must order you to go.$ I'm not a child.$ Yes.Please, come.$ Then, Ardeth Bay, au revoir.$ But we must see each other again.$ I shall be honored.$ An unusual crime.$ A guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum.$ A gift?$ A scroll.$ Part of which was transcribed when it was first found.$ Here is the transcription.$ I cannot read the writing of a period so remote.$ But you read the name of Anck-es-en-Amon on that piece of pottery.$ That was of the 18th Dynasty.$ These are Predynastic ideographs.$ The scroll from which this was copied was stolen 10 years ago, together with the mummy of the High Priest Imhotep.$ Most interesting.$ May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?$ We left it at the museum.$ So.$ I have something else to show you.$ A photograph.$ Why do you show all this to me?$ Do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen, but restored to a semblance of life by the spell from the Scroll of...$ That scroll is my property.$ I bought it from a dealer.$ It is here in this house.$ I presume in that room.$ We had foreseen this.$ The scroll is in safe hands, and will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us.$ You have studied our ancient arts, and you know that you cannot harm me.$ You also know that you must return that scroll to me or die.$ Now tell that weak fool to get that scroll, wherever it is, and hand it to his Nubian servant.$ The Nubian!$ The ancient blood.$ So you have made him your slave.$ If I could get my hands on you,I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.$ But your power is too strong.$ This is the evil force that has been attacking her.$ Burn the scroll, man.$ Burn it!$ It was through you this horror came into existence.$ It's true.It's true.$ Your father destroyed the scroll, knowing that it would cost him his life.$ What's that?$ Isis, the Egyptian symbol of life.$ I meant it for your father.$ What good could that old charm have done him?$ I tell you, the doctors say it's a plain case of heart failure.$ The Nubian is missing.$ He's an old servant.$ He was frightened, but he'll be back.$ Don't try and make me believe that this Ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life.$ It was that idea and the horror of it that killed my father.$ The museum guard died of natural causes, too.$ Frank, I need your help.$ I saw your attraction to my patient last night, and hers to you.$ Hers to me?$ Do you really think so?$ And I welcomed it.$ But do you think I have a chance?$ 'Cause I think she's the most...$ But this is terrible at a time like this.$ Frank, I'm afraid.$ Will you go with me to her now?Yes.$ Then telephone her first not to leave the hotel.$ 9-5-9-0.$ No, I'm not going out.$ Yes, I promise to wait until you get here.$ Goodbye.$ And I'm so dreadfully sorry.$ What were you doing, Doctor?$ Your father did not burn the Scroll of Thoth.$ That creature has it now.$ But the ashes in the fireplace.$ They were newspaper.$ The scroll is papyrus.$ Then it was murder.$ The Nubian.$ Wear this around your neck.$ Why?$ When we fight this creature, we must ask protection from the forces of old that it defied.$ I'll give it to Helen.$ She's the one that needs protection.No.$ Her life is not in danger.$ It is her soul.$ Should love for you come to her, he will try to destroy you.$ That amulet, the Egyptians believe, was a charm against evil sendings such as struck down your father.$ Your dog is frightened.$ My servant will see to him.$ Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.$ Ancient Egypt.$ Nothing modern.$ What a strange incense.$ Is it not familiar to you?$ No.$ Our forefathers used it.$ Yours and mine.$ You will not remember what I show you now, and yet I shall awaken memories of love and crime and death.$ I knelt by the bed of death.$ Thy father's last farewell.$ I knew the Scroll of Thoth could bring thee back to life.$ I dared the gods' anger and stole it.$ I stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life.$ I murmured the spell that raises the dead, but they broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing.$ Thy father condemned me to the nameless death.$ The scroll he ordered buried with me, that no such sacrilege might disgrace Egypt again.$ A nameless grave.$ The slaves were killed so that none should know.$ The soldiers who killed them were also slain, so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit.$ Anck-es-en-Amon.$ My love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods.$ No man ever suffered as I did for you.$ But the rest you may not know.$ Not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph, until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love.$ Until I send back your spirit that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages.$ But before then, Bast must again send forth death.$ Death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart.$ Love that would keep you from myself.$ Love that might bring sickness and even death to you.$ Awake.$ Have I been asleep?$ I had strange dreams.$ Dreams of Ancient Egypt, I think.$ There was someone like you in them.$ My pool is sometimes troubled.$ One sees strange fantasies in the water, but they pass like dreams.$ My dog!$ Wolfram!Wolfram!$ Where is he?$ Helen.$ Helen, where have you been?$ We've been so worried.$ We've hunted everywhere.$ In the museum again?$ Yes.$ Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.$ Well, if I must give an explanation, it was stuffy in here.$ I can't be shut up all the time.$ Besides, I don't like the feeling that I'm always being watched.$ I took the dog with me.$ Well, where is the dog?$ He's dead.$ But how?$ I don't know.$ Where?$ I don't remember.$ But I can see it now, standing on poor Wolfram's back, a white cat.$ A white cat?$ The cat goddess, Bast.$ Yes, there was a statue of Bast.$ The goddess of evil sendings!$ Just what happened?$ Try to remember, Helen.$ I don't want to remember.$ Besides, I don't see that it's any affair of yours.$ Oh, but it is.$ We know that you were with Ardeth Bay.$ Oh, Helen.Helen, I love you.$ I'm trying to help you and protect you.$ We all are.$ Don't let me go again.$ I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me, no matter what I do or what I say.$ There's death there for me, and life for something else inside me that isn't me.$ But it's alive, too, and fighting for life.$ Save me from it, Frank.$ Save me.$ Oh, everything's going to be all right.$ Now that you've asked for help, I'll never leave you alone.$ I'll get Mrs. Muller down here with you, and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.$ And then, we'll take you to my house.$ Oh, Helen, it's been such torture.$ I love you so.$ I don't like that doctor.$ Please go in there and find out what he's saying about me.$ I will, my dear.$ He'll know just what's the matter with you, and cure you.$ Now, don't worry.$ Now, Miss Sparling, help me to get dressed and get out of here.$ It's come over you again, Miss Grosvenor.$ I must escape.I'm being held here.$ You must help me.$ But you told me when these fits came on, I wasn't to listen.$ I have a friend.He's rich.$ He'll give you money.$ Now you just lie down again.$ You know you mustn't get up.$ Well, if you don't want money, what do you want most?$ He'll give you anything, if only you'll help me to go to him.$ You want me to call Dr. Muller?$ No.$ I hate him.$ I'll die if I don't get away from him.Now, Miss Grosvenor...$ It's killing me.$ Do you hear?Please, please!$ Now, Helen, you must not do this again.$ You're always so exhausted afterwards.$ She's too weak to be removed, except to a hospital.$ I insist on keeping her here under our direct observation.$ But Dr. LeBarron, you haven't told us what to do for her.$ She's getting weaker every day.$ You know that negligee I bought in Paris?$ Help me to put it on, and bring me my toilet things.$ I want some color.$ I want to look well.$ But you can't do that, my dear.$ They'd never allow it.$ The nurse would be...I know.$ We'll get rid of her.$ This is a plot, just between us.$ I want to look the way I did.$ Just a surprise, for Frank.$ And I want you to bring him to me.You understand?$ In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.$ Medical science is helpless in a case like this.$ Frank.$ Go to her, and don't be angry with me.$ I couldn't resist her.$ Oh, but Helen, you shouldn't have done this.$ They shouldn't have let you.$ Just this once.$ Perhaps the last time.$ But you're going to get well.$ Then I know I can make you love me.$ I know I can make you happy.$ I do love you, Frank.$ And I'm trying to prove it, because I'd rather die than live and lose you.$ But you're going to live.$ We're not going to lose each other.$ So, my dear...$ Don't scold me.$ Just feminine vanity.$ I wanted to look my best again.$ So you know more than I realized you knew.$ What do you mean?$ These impulses to go to him.$ The pull is too strong to withstand and live.$ I'm so glad you understand.$ Helen knows.$ She knows the moment she stops struggling, he will give her back her strength to come to him.$ But I don't want to lose my own mind and be someone else, someone I hate.$ My dear, while you were growing worse, we tried to find him and failed.$ The next time the call comes, go to him.$ Muller, what can we do now?$ We can do no more.$ Ardeth has beaten me.$ The next time he draws her to him, we must follow her.$ And then?$ We will destroy him.$ I've given her some bromide.$ She's asleep now.$ I'll go to bed.$ All right.$ I'll wait here till Dr. Muller comes.$ Good night.$ Good night.$ Where are we?$ This is my bed, but this is not the temple nor my father's palace.$ Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.$ Do not be afraid.$ I was afraid.$ When you were kneeling beside my bed, a veil came over my eyes.Darkness.$ Your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as I knelt by your bed, 3,700 years ago.$ No man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me.$ And now that the gods have forgiven us...$ No, no, not yet.$ Your soul is in a mortal body, renewed many times since we loved in Thebes of old.$ But that love is not for us again until the great change.$ I do not understand.$ Look.$ Look and wonder.$ Figure of myself.$ It is my coffin, made by my father against my death.$ What mummy has usurped my eternal resting place?$ It is thy dead shell.$ I tried then to raise this body.$ I could raise it now.But it would be a mere thing that moved at my will, without a soul.$ It was not only this body that I loved.It was thy soul.$ I destroy this lifeless thing.$ Thou shalt take its place but for a few moments, and then rise again, even as I have risen.$ Come.$ Imhotep, this is the place of embalmment.$ It is not lawful for me, a priestess of Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.$ Come to the altar of Anubis, the guide of the dead.$ The time has come for the final prayers.$ What have I to do with Anubis?$ The ancient rites must be performed over thy body.$ Then I will read the great spell with which Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.$ And thou shalt rise again.$ No.$ No, I'm alive!$ I'm young!$ I won't die!$ I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead.$ I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...I'm somebody else, too.$ I want to live, even in this strange new world.$ For thy sake I was buried alive.$ I ask of thee only a moment of agony.$ Only so can we be united.$ The bath of natron.$ You shall not plunge my body into that!$ Let the deed be done.$ Let me go!Let me go!$ Don't kill me!$ I'm a priestess of Isis!$ Save me from that mummy!$ It's dead!Save me!$ I no longer fear you.$ Do with me what you will.$ Frank!$ She's gone to him.$ They must be in the museum.$ Now I know his horrible plan.$ He's going to kill her and make her a living mummy, like himself.$ The gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.$ But not for long.$ Osiris will release thy soul.$ You shall rest from life, like the setting sun in the West.But you shall dawn anew in the East as the first rays of Amon-Ra dispel the shadows.$ Look!$ What's that?$ Come on!$ Frank!Frank!$ Helen!$ Oh, Isis!Holy Maiden!$ I was thy consecrated vestal.$ I broke my vows.Save me now!$ Teach me the ancient summons, the holy spells I've forgotten.$ I call upon thee as of old!$ Helen.$ Call her.$ He has dragged her back to Ancient Egypt.$ Call her!$ Her love for you may

Nothing like it after you get used to it.$ I've been married and divorced twice.I ought to know.$ Somebody give Jim a drink.$ He looks grouchy.$ Powerful cider, ain't it, Tom?$ Any harder, it'd bounce.$ There you go.$ Nothing.$ One two three.$ Hey.$ Oh, come on.$ I like playing Post Office.It's almost my favorite game.$ Six letters and seven postcards for Mr. McDowell.$ Yes, sir.$ It's old Bull.$ I only wish the mail was from Mrs. Gilson.$ Look out for her husband, Bull.$ Look out he don't shoot you, Bull.$ Oh, give her a kiss for me, Bull.$ Come on out of there, Bull!$ Gee, you're giving him the whole sack of mail.$ Now it's your turn, Joan.$ Give the bride a chance.$ Don't be ashamed, we've all been brides ourselves once.$ A long time ago.$ Well.$ A letter and a postcard for Jim Gilson.$ Come on, Jim.$ Go get her.$ Gee, it is great to be married.$ You needn't be afraid.$ I'm not afraid, Jim.$ You know that.$ I won't bother you anymore.$ Oh, don't talk that way.It's so silly.I...$ I'm sorry I slapped you that first night.$ I guess you meant it, all right.$ But I didn't.I didn't mean it, I...$ Well, it was all so fast and I...$ Listen, listen, listen.$ It's getting late, folks, and we've kept these people up long enough.$ Let's get going.$ We'll all be going.$ It's been a grand shivaree.$ That was a great time, boys.$ Hey, get Joe.He's laying over there behind the box.$ We've had a good time.$ Good night, folks, me and Skins got plans.$ Come on, straighten up.I'm straightened up.$ Say, Skins, you want a little nightcap?$ Sure I want a nightcap.$ Yes,

to bed.$ Oh, come on, girl, kiss me good night.$ You gonna break my accordion, eh?$ Hey, wait a second.What's the matter...?$ Oh, you shouldn't have done that to my friend Forgan.$ He's a fine fellow.$ He just can't hold his liquor as good as me.$ Drunk or not, I don't wanna...Tuttuttut.$ Everything is all right.$ Nobody is mad at anybody.$ Everybody loves everybody.$ Well, good night.$ You go straight to bed and don't do nothing I wouldn't do.$ Pigs.$ All of them.$ I thought it was kind of fun.$ This place looks like a cyclone struck it.$ Do you feel the cider?$ No.$ I do.My head is spinning.$ Well, go to bed.$ I'll clean up.$ Well, good night.$ Good night.$ Don't bother with that, Jim.$ I'll do it in the morning.$ Jim, have you always lived on this farm alone?$ Not always.$ Last spring I had a woman named Hazel keeping house for me.$ You had a woman living here?$ Yep, Hazel.$ She was an Indian squaw.$ Well, she weighed 250 pounds and she smelled.$ Took me two weeks to get rid of the bedbugs after I got rid of her.$ How awful.$ Yeah.$ Morning, Al.$ Morning.$ I got a letter for you from Mr. Peters at the bank.$ Thanks.$ Goodbye, Mrs. Gilson.$ Bye.$ Won't you tell me what's wrong?$ I promised you protection and a home.$ Well, I can't give them to you.$ The bank's just notified me we've got to get off this land.$ Leave the farm?$ It's mortgaged to the hilt.$ The bank threatens to foreclose.$ How much do you need?$ Eight hundred dollars.$ I stand as much chance of raising 8 million.$ You might borrow.$ On what and from whom?$ It's driving me crazy trying to pay the bills I owe now.$ What do you intend to do with me?$ Send you back to Montreal, if I can ever raise the money.$ No use prolonging the agony.$ Has it been agony?$ Well, it must have been for you.$ Things have only just started.$ You don't know these northwest winters.$ They're bad enough when you got everything that money can buy.$ But you haven't the comforts...$ You know of course, that there's nothing, no one for me to go back to.$ I'm afraid we'll have to stick it out together some way.$ But our marriage is hopeless.$ We started all wrong.$ Like going into a race blindfolded.$ Would you mind moving those bags so I can really clean this room?$ But I told you we were leaving.$ Maybe.$ Do you know what's in those sacks?$ Seed wheat, isn't it?$ That's the best seed that ever got into a gunnysack.$ It took first prize at Calgary, same in Chicago.$ That makes it the best wheat in the world.$ And you grew it.$ Yeah, after 11 years of slaving and sweating.$ Ever since I left agricultural college, I starved, literally starved.$ Well, I fertilized and crossfertilized and experimented with crop after crop until the strain was fixed.$ This seed will produce the heaviest head of whiteflower wheat that's ever been grown.$ There's a fortune in a crop of it.$ More money than I've ever seen or ever will see.$ And when the goal is in sight, after 11 years of struggle, you're willing to quit.$ What else can I do?$ Stay here.Plant your seed.$ You can't plant until spring.$ By that time, this land will no longer belong to me.$ That's my proposition, Jim.$ Think it over.$ We'll never be able to do business on those terms.$ Good evening, Mrs. Gilson.$ Good evening, Mr. McDowell.$ I just offered your husband to shoulder all his mortgages take over all outstanding notes and put him on a salary if he'll let me take over the farm and work it my way.$ Is he going to accept?$ Well, there's just one obstacle.$ I'm not interested in the deed unless you come over and run my house for me.$ I'm a rotten housekeeper and a worse cook.$ I'll risk it.$ And I've got a bad temper.$ Me too.We have a lot in common.$ Well, I'll have to talk it over with Jim first.$ Sure, only don't make me wait too long.$ I'm not altogether sold on this outfit, but I could get sold on you, Mrs. Gilson.$ Don't strain yourself.$ Are you going to accept McDowell's proposition?$ I saw him talking to you.$ Are you?$ I don't see why I shouldn't.$ Well, you know what it means.$ A chance of keeping this farm and letting you go on with your work.$ I've found that keeping house for a man can be done on quite an impersonal basis.$ After all, I'm only doing what any servant could do.$ Even Hazel with her 250 pounds and her bedbugs.$ I haven't given you very much of a break.$ I was thinking of the future.$ Well, since I was crazy enough to drag you out here will you please leave that future in my hands for the next few weeks?$ All right, all right, all right.$ Come in.$ Good morning.$ Golly, it's cold.$ Haven't seen anything yet.$ Winter's just started.$ You're a comfort.$ Isn't there any paper around here?$ Here.$ This ought to be enough to start a fire.$ The last day of the year, and what a year.$ That's the last of the coal.$ You waste too much trying to keep this place too warm.$ Too warm?$ Why, I've hardly stopped shivering since I left Montreal.$ You got all the bedclothes.$ What?$ Well, I guess we'll have to ride over to Glover's farm and get another load of coal.$ How far is that?$ We leave after breakfast we can get back by midnight.$ Oh, practically just next door.$ Coffee ready?Yes.$ What time is it?$ Two minutes to 12.$ Then we have two minutes to wait.$ What?$ Nothing.$ You hate me, don't you?$ No, but...$ Well, what's wrong, Jim?$ I can't forget the look on your face that first night...$ I've been able to forget.Why can't you?$ That isn't the question.$ It's just that I've never done anything to earn your love.$ Isn't love the one thing you don't have to earn?$ Well, it seems to me it ought to be a natural sort of partnership.Have...$ Have you ever heard a woman scream?$ No.$ Well, you're going to.Huh?$ Because I've been dying to do it for months.$ I'm Mrs. Gilson.$ I've just heard that there's a new baby here.$ Can I do anything to help?$ Have you had anything to eat?$ Where's your husband?$ He went away.$ Has the doctor been here?$ No.$ Hasn't anyone been here with you while...?$ Just Sarah.$ You poor little lamb.$ But don't worry, everything will be all right.$ Now, Sarah, you and I have a lot of work to do around here.$ Is there any milk?$ Is there any milk?$ There's some in the pail.$ Hurry up and get me a saucepanfull.$ Sarah, I told you to get me some milk.$ We'll take care of you in a jiffy, Mrs. Tipton.$ And is there any flour?$ I'd like to make some bread.$ It's in that tin.$ All right, you get a bowl and put the flour in it.$ It's awful to have a baby, isn't it?$ No, darling.It's wonderful.$ The most wonderful thing in the world.$ There, now.$ He's all dressed for company.$ Sarah, take the baby over to your mother.$ No, please, Mrs. Gilson.$ I don't wanna touch it.$ Now, isn't that silly.$ Hold your brother, Sarah.$ Do as I say.$ He's a wonderful baby, Mrs. Tipton.$ I don't know what we would have done without you.$ Sure you don't want me to spend the night with you?$ I won't need a thing, dear.$ It started to snow.$ You better run along home before it gets too dark.$ God bless you.$ Mrs. Gilson.$ Yes, dear?$ Don't worry about them, because I can take care of them now.$ Joan!$ Joan!$ Jim!Jim!Jim!$ Are you all right?$ Yes, I'm fine.$ How's the new baby?$ Oh, it's adorable.$ Oh, Jim, if we only could...$ Nothing.$ I had to take a man in for the night.$ He got lost on his way to Elk's Crossing.$ I didn't have the heart to put him out in weather like this.$ This is Mrs. Gilson, my wife.$ How do you do?$ How do you do?$ My wife's had a hard ride across the prairie.$ What she needs is a good, hot supper.$ Ed, of all the people in the world, what are you doing out here?$ You know I'm still pretty crazy about you, Joan.$ But how on earth did you ever find me?$ Waco located you in Montreal.$ I traced you from there.$ Taking a powder on me for this.$ You know, it's all a big mystery to me.$ Screw out on a guy that can give you everything in the world to live in a pigpen.$ It's not as bad as all that, Eddie.$ He's a big cluck or he wouldn't make you live in a joint like this.$ Well, anyhow, I found you and I'm hanging on to you.$ Oh, please don't, Ed.$ Ed, let me speak to my husband alone for a minute.$ Please get out.$ How long have you known that man?$ Years.$ Then why did you pretend to be strangers?Because I...$ Well, when I came in and found him sitting here I was too surprised to say anything or do anything.$ That's a ridiculous lie.$ But you don't have to explain.$ I suppose you figure it's none of my business.$ Oh, Jim, you've got to listen to me.$ It's so hard to make you understand.$ I knew Ed in New York while I was working in the chorus of a musical show.$ He was...$ Don't keep looking at me that way.I'm telling you the truth.$ I swear I am.$ We were together almost three years.$ Then I ran away to Montreal.$ How many others were there besides him?$ You get pleasure from torturing me, don't you?$ A real joke you and I played on each other.$ A rotten, hopeless marriage and find your married to a dirty little...$ Don't say that!Oh, we're a beautiful couple all right.$ You thought I could give you a home, and I thought you were decent...$ Shut up!$ Stop it!$ And we both...$ Shut up!Don't say that!$ But, honey, the man doesn't love you.$ You know that.$ I love him.$ I'll make him love me.$ Don't be silly.$ We'll drive to Vancouver, catch a boat for the Orient, then Europe, Paris.$ I got 300 grand in cold cash.$ I told you I'm staying here.$ You're so wrong, it isn't even funny.$ You're the daffiest dame in the world.$ I offer you...$ What's the use.$ So long, pal.$ So long, you chump.$ Dishwater.$ Well, I'm hanging around Elk's Crossing for a little while in case you change your mind and get smart.$ Elk's Crossing is a dull little town, Eddie.$ And I'm as smart now as I ever will be.$ Thanks for letting me sleep here last night.$ I appreciate it.$ Fifteen days more, Gilson.$ That's all you get.$ Why can't I plant my wheat and pay you out of the proceeds like you promised last summer?$ We didn't definitely promise.$ Besides, your mortgage interest has been due since last fall.$ We ought to have foreclosed months ago.$ Jim thinks banks are charity institutes.$ You engineered this deal.$ The bank was willing to wait.$ You hadn't offered cash on my land, the bank wouldn't be foreclosing.$ Is it a crime to buy what I can pay for?$ It is, when you're doing it just to work off a personal grudge against me.$ I made you a fair proposition.$ I offered to take over your debts if...$ If I let my wife become your...$ That's your idea of a fair proposition.$ Well, let me tell you something.$ I'm not licked yet.I've still got 15 days.$ Is Mr Eddie Fields in?$ You can certainly find him in the beer hall next door or playing pool at Sam's.$ Thank you.$ Ed.$ Well, for the love of...$ Come on, honey, sit down.$ Will you have something to drink?$ No, thanks.$ Say, this is swell.$ Every time I thought of you out in that shanty, I got the creeps.$ You're wrong, Ed.$ I've been very happy there.$ Don't give me that.$ I mean it.$ Your missus is over in the beer hall.$ I reckon she's thirsty.$ Ed, will you lend me $ 800?$ Are you kidding?$ Sure, that's piker money.$ You're a grand guy.$ Double in spades.$ Eight hundred enough?$ Plenty.$ And thanks a million.$ Give him the dough and come on to Vancouver with me.$ I love him.Can't you understand that?$ Yeah, and the tougher the going, the more you love him.$ It looks that way.$ Just a natural mud lark.$ I'm so grateful, Eddie.$ Oh, lay off, will you?$ Jim, don't.$ Fight!Come on, get up!$ Get out of here, you!$ Boy, what a slug.$ There he is.$ Now keep him.$ I told you I don't want him.$ I swear I don't.$ No other man means anything else to me now.$ Oh, you gotta believe me.$ Doesn't this prove it?$ Would I be doing this unless I wanted you more than anything else in the whole world?$ Jim.$ Giddyup.$ I'm your wife and I love you.$ And I'm going with you whether you want me to or not.$ Seven fifty, 800.$ Right.$ Now, you understand about the letter to my husband?$ Why, certainly.$ Thank you.$ Oh, boy.$ They sure have up to now.$ Jim!Jim!$ What is it?$ The wheat's on fire.$ Grab a blanket from your bed.$ Oh, Jim, our wheat.$ I'll die if any...$ Shut up.$ Come on.$ Take that one over there.$ Jim, you've caught one of those terrible summer colds.$ Well, you'll have to take some quinine and some hot lemonade and a hotwater bottle.$ And I'm going to put you right to bed.$ Subtitles:Luís Filipe Bernardes$

Jerusalem.$ Another Helen of Troy, only more beautiful.$ Good night, Empress.$ Morpheus give you deep slumber.$ Thank you.$ I'd rather have exciting dreams.$ I'd love to share them.$ Look out!$ Get back!$ Get back!$ Careless, drunken dog!$ Arrest him!$ Why, Marcus.$ What an impetuous young man.$ Empress!$ Is this your carriage?$ It was.$ And I might have been in it.$ Oh, the gods forbid.$ I shall beg your pardon properly tomorrow.$ Why not tonight?$ Because I'm in great haste tonight, on the Emperor's most urgent business.$ Come here.$ I'm the Emperor's most urgent business.$ Do as I tell you!$ Your wishes are sacred to everyone, Empress.$ I doubt that.$ Where have you been for days?$ I expected you here at Dacia's house tonight.$ Must I sacrifice a carriage in order to catch a glimpse of you?$ Tomorrow you shall have a very colorful account of everything.$ Where are you rushing to tonight?$ Is it a love affair?$ I hope it may end in one.$ I thought it was something of the sort.$ Where are you really going, Marcus?$ The Empress is romantic and must understand that I...$ No, I don't.$ You must explain.$ I will.$ I will, tomorrow.$ Tonight, Marcus.$ And you will be amused.$ And so, Empress...$ Marcus.$ Good night.$ Marcus, I insist.$ Follow them.$ Find out who she is.$ Since knowing him and since following the truth... old habits have slipped from my body.$ There are no longer any earthly bonds confining my spirit.$ All is at peace within me.$ If every living man knew what I know... if I could be sure that the message is in every heart...I could be wholly at peace.$ As Jesus loved God, so he loved his brothers... who are also the children of God.$ With understanding, with faith... he held power over all things, even death.$ He proved there is no death... only a crossing over to the Father... and life everlasting.$ Jesus knew it.$ He lived it.$ He walked the earth in goodness... telling that we're all of his blood, his spirit.$ Work for one another, comfort one another... that was his cry.$ Love your neighbor as yourself.$ That is what he came to teach mankind.$ That message is heard.$ It will be carried to all men... to the farthest corners of the earth.$ And God will walk among us... and you will go out into the world... and you will carry to your brothers a new life... and that new life is freedom.$ Freedom as vast and beautiful as heaven is.$ And...$ Why, look!$ It's an arrow.$ He's hit.$ Titus is shot.$ Where did it come from?$ Look!$ The Emperor's soldiers!$ Flank out.$ We are betrayed.$ Oh, merciful Father!$ Titus!$ Titus!$ Put out the brands!$ Death is nothing to fear.$ Father, no!$ Father!$ Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.$ Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those... who trespass against us.$ Blessed are they who are persecuted for...$ Favius!$ Mercia, my dear.$ I...$ It's Marcus!$ Marcus Superbus!$ Hark, the Prefect.Stop firing!$ Mercia.$ He's dying.$ Favius.$ Come with me.$ Quick.$ Isn't that the girl you were talking to at the fountain, Marcus?$ You couldn't have known that she was a Christian... or you wouldn't have let her go after hearing the Emperor's orders.$ Why was this execution stopped?$ Your apparent concern for these Christians is traitorous.$ Withdraw that.$ If I was too hasty, I'm sorry.$ Help him.$ Can't you do something?$ Peace be with you.$ With you both.$ Go and find them!$ If you find them, make them talk!$ Well, what are the Prefect's orders?$ What's to be done with the Christians?$ Say you will lean on me.$ I can't hold on much longer.$ I'm dying.$ Viturius...look after the wounded... and take the others to the Martian prison.$ Why to the Martian prison?$ Why not to the arena dungeon?$ Let it stand as I said.$ To the Martian prison!$ In God's name, be merciful to us!$ God is mercy.$ Come on.$ Viturius!$ Here, Excellence.$ At the change of watch tonight, take the girl from prison.$ Bring her to my house.$ Put a woman servant with her.$ Excellence, that's dangerous sport.$ Do it.$ Yes, Excellence.$ Daughter.$ Oh, Lord.$ Mama.$ Come, little sister.$ I'll take care of you.$ Come on, come on.$ Here's one you forgot.$ You sent for me, Empress?$ Having to send for you hurt my vanity a bit.$ Oh, I'm sorry, Empress.$ Leave us.$ You don't need to call me Empress.$ I should have been here earlier to apologize for my rudeness last night.$ Oh, don't bother.$ I've since learned why you had to be so abrupt.$ And you have these enemies of Nero safely in prison.$ It's true, isn't it?$ Yes.$ All of them?$ Yes.$ Even this baby-faced Christian girl?$ Tell me.$ Even this girl who parades as innocence and purity... and is the scum of Rome?$ Poppaea!$ Why, you're angry.$ You misunderstand.$ I have no serious interest in the girl.$ Oh, don't be stupid.$ All Rome knows that she's in your house... and Rome is laughing about it.$ Well?$ Sit close to me, Marcus.$ I've loved you.$ You've never returned that love.$ You've hardly been friendly.$ Oh, I know.$ You haven't wanted a vile court intrigue with me.$ I haven't either, particularly.$ But what else is there?$ So I've waited... thinking you've kept away out of loyalty to Nero... and that finally you would... comfort me in spite of it.$ So I've waited... being jealous and hurt... while you played with a dozen less admirable women.$ But this is different.$ Knowing I cared for you... you've preferred to make a fool of yourself over this Christian outcast.$ Yes, you are right.$ I am loyal to the Emperor.$ Too loyal to aspire to an intrigue with the Empress.$ Is that evasion?$ No, it's the truth.$ Then I shall go on hoping to make you forget that loyalty.$ If I can't, someday... to my shame...I may command you to forget.$ Your pardon, Empress.$ Marcus.$ Marcus.Do you love this girl?$ Answer me!$ Well, then I...$ I don't know.$ That says you perhaps do.$ I could laugh with Rome about it if I didn't care so much.$ Marcus Superbus... caught at last by a Christian wanton.$ You've no right to call her that.$ Oh, very much in love.$ Well, why not?$ It's not so impossible, so laughable.$ She's young, beautiful, virtuous.$ I find I'm sick of patrician women... who haven't heard of virtue.$ That's a direct enough insult.$ I couldn't avoid it.$ I never saw a man who held his life so cheaply.$ That sounds like a threat.$ I've never threatened with you.$ I shan't, unless you drive me to it.$ The game is dangerous enough without my threats.$ Tigellinus knows what you've done.$ No citizen can protect a Christian from the law.$ Well, in this case, I...$ I can't stop to remember the law.$ Then I shall make you stop to remember me.$ You'll give up this girl, Marcus.$ Will I?$ Yes.$ You'll forget about her entirely.$ I've stayed too long.$ Empress.$ They were meeting openly, conspiring openly against your life... and Marcus wouldn't permit them to be killed.$ Do I make myself understood, Caesar?$ The wine last night, the music... the delicious debauchery.$ My head is splitting.$ Caesar, will Marcus go so far as your overthrow... and your death?$ Why are you always frightening me like that?$ Plots against my life.$ Death rides in the street with me, he eats out of my plate.$ Marcus took them to prison and there released the most dangerous of them.$ That can't be true.$ How much further will he go?$ I'll stop him right here.$ I've been too lenient.$ I'll make an example of Marcus.$ I order him to be seized.$ I shan't rest until he's dead.$ Until who is dead?$ Poppaea.$ Do you know what Marcus has done?$ Yes.$ I think it's very amusing.$ You...$ I'm telling you he's turned traitor.$ He's released some dangerous Christians.$ Oh, just one.$ A pretty little Christian girl, not dangerous to anyone... except Marcus himself.$ But, beloved...$ Marcus is just a man with a thrilling weakness.$ He took this girl to his house.$ He's such a willful, energetic boy.$ Rome is amused, and you're alarmed.$ Shame on you.$ Caesar, the edict was not obeyed.$ Yes.Can you be amused at that, Poppaea?$ I can, because it was the girl's fault.$ Destroy the girl... not your most devoted, reliable officer.$ Simply give Tigellinus an order to take her out of Marcus' hands.$ Nero, beloved... don't listen to everyone when you have me.$ You'll make a blunder someday that will make people laugh at you... the same as they're laughing at Marcus now.$ I'm not at all well, Poppaea.$ I know.$ You had such an exciting night.$ There now, relax.$ Caesar, if I...$ How can you disturb our beloved Emperor when he's feeling so badly?$ If it's the order for the girl you're concerned about...I'll dictate that myself.$ Beloved, there.$ Marcus!$ Marcus, where are you going?$ Be careful, Marcus.$ Ancaria won't let her go.$ What ails you, Marcus?$ Is it your heart or your stomach?$ By Jupiter's thunderbolt, Marcus... you haven't finished your cup!$ Something needs my attention, something very personal.$ Keep it going!$ Bring her here.$ What's all this about?$ Why have you left the table?$ Why eat stale bread when there's luscious food in the house?$ You go on back.$ Go on back and make my apologies.$ Luscious food?$ Oh!$ I see.$ Yes.$ Marcus.$ Yeah.$ I hear Christians aren't digestible.$ Never mind, never mind.$ Go on, go on.$ Marcus!$ I intended to see you sooner.$ Oh, Marcus.$ I couldn't understand why you didn't.$ I was called to the palace.$ And then this banquet's been raging since noon.$ Marcus, I told you last night... my life means more now than...$ Suddenly everything changed.$ I wanted to live.$ You will, Mercia.$ How can I now?$ Some way, it will be done.$ You belong here with me, and you'll stay.$ Oh, you don't know what I'm saying.$ I can't live if the others are killed.$ Something must be done for them.$ No, it's impossible.$ Not to you.Isn't there something?No.$ No, you'll have to forget them.$ I couldn't.$ There'd be no happiness for the rest of my life.$ Oh, that's absurd.$ Even with you.$ Try to help them.$ What do they mean to us?$ I'm one of them.$ Not anymore.$ I don't understand you.$ There's nothing to understand.$ You're here, that's all.$ They don't exist anymore.$ Oh, wait, Marcus.$ An entirely new life begins for you.$ With me.$ Tonight.$ I see.$ Oh, Mercia.$ I was very simple.$ I thought there'd be something better for you and me.$ Better?$ It doesn't matter to you what I think or feel, so long as I'm here.$ It never did matter.$ Oh, Marcus... you never meant anything but to make me one of your slaves.$ Don't think of it that way.$ I want you here.$ You want to be with me, you'll have everything with me.$ No, I'd rather go back to them.$ We have a right to this.$ I can't see it like that, I can't.$ Well, then something has twisted you out of all natural feeling.$ Your kind of life, your faith has done it.$ I've always believed Christianity was merely stupid... but it's vicious if it can do this to you.$ Where is this luscious food?$ Careful, Marcus.$ Ancaria has blood in her eye.$ If the host deserts his guests, the guests shall find the host.$ And here we are.$ I hope never to rise again.$ Look out, Marcus.$ Here she comes.$ Ancaria!$ Marcus!$ Without you, there's no flavor to the feast.$ Marcus... you and I are wasting the evening.$ Why...$ By the back of Venus, look!$ A Christian girl!$ I've heard of her.$ Marcus plays host all over the house.$ A beauty, Marcus.$ Why hide her, Marcus?$ So this was the enchantment.$ Present us, Marcus.$ Or aren't we virtuous enough?$ It would, perhaps, help you both to know each other.$ The lady Mercia, this is Ancaria... the most wicked and talented woman in Rome.$ And my friends, who are content with life.$ Come and join us.$ Bring her out.$ No.$ Leave her alone.$ Let's look at this model of purity.$ She looks ripe enough for any party.$ Tell us, Marcus, was she pleasant?$ Superior to me?$ Why, she's frozen with virtue.$ Couldn't you warm her into life?$ No.$ No, I tried, but I couldn't.$ See what you can do, Ancaria.$ Try one of your songs.$ Yes.$ A song, Ancaria.$ Perfect.$ If that doesn't do it, she's dead.$ A love song, Ancaria... with the pantomime.$ Can you melt snow, Ancaria?$ Sing.$ Try it.$ Dance, Ancaria.Dance the Naked Moon!$ Start the music!$ The last time she danced that...$ Don't tell!$ The moon would blush at Ancaria's dancing.$ I must have missed that.$ Play!$ Play the Naked Moon.$ She's only got two.$ Under the naked moon$ I found you$ We meet$ I've seen you in my dreams$ In dreams indiscreet$ With torture so sweet$ I've loved you in dreams$ Breathe upon me$ Draw me$ Gently touch my heart$ What's that singing?$ The Christians, on their way to the arena dungeon.$ I've danced to dirges, but I couldn't dance to that.$ Go on, Ancaria.$ Go on.$ Why, you haven't even started to undress the moon.$ I can't go on when they are singing like that.$ Drown them out!$ A love song is stronger than a fanatical dirge.$ Keep on!$ Play!$ Love will be warm$ In the gold of your hair$ Feed from your lips$ Atremble with mysteries old$ Persuasive, then bold$ Until his madness outstrips$ I breathe upon you$ Draw unto you$ And let love spread his wings$ We have been two$ We shall be one$ Both throb$ They're coming closer!$ They're louder.Why don't you stop them, Marcus?$ Then sing louder yourself!$ Play!$ Oh!$ We have been two$ We shall be one$ What are you smiling at?$ Why, you...$ I told you to stop them!$ Get out!$ I told you I couldn't stand...$ All of you, get out!$ And leave me alone with her.$ You, take her out.$ Good luck, Marcus.$ You'll be back with me!$ Well, right now I've got better sport.$ Go on, get out!$ Get out!$ I've heard of worse.$ Stop that, Ancaria!$ Remove the lights.$ Close the room.$ Ancaria was frightened by the Christians' singing... but I'm not impressed.$ Please send me back to them.$ No.$ Not yet, at least.$ Not until you live as you were meant to live.$ Marcus, listen to me.$ I don't want to live like this.$ I want to die with them.$ You mean you'd give up life with me... and would rather die for a belief, for some vague...$ It isn't vague.$ It's certain.$ One man proved it.$ He changed men with it.$ It's an illusion.$ It's madness, I tell you.$ Rome and mankind will go on as they are forever.$ Your Christianity will be stamped out and dead within a year.$ I know better.$ Mercia, don't you see what this thing has done to you?$ It hasn't let you live.$ It's deformed you.$ It's made love impossible to...$ As you look at love, yes, not as I look at it.$ I've no use for your kind of happiness.$ Send me back to them.$ No, you're not going to die with them.$ You're going to live with me.$ Did you

the Christians tomorrow.$ Take her.$ I tell you, she's not leaving here.$ No, Marcus.$ It's a pity she stopped you.$ I like you so little...I wish you had called your men and prevented my taking her.$ It would have cost your life.$ I hold the Emperor's order.$ Face!$ Forward!$ Caesar, I pledge my honor... that she shall never menace the people of Rome... nor your own most sacred life.$ Only let her live.$ It must be love that has made Marcus so lenient of Christians.$ Yes...I do love her.$ If this one Christian life will make our Marcus happy...$ Is Nero justice in the Roman world, or merely a puppet Emperor?$ What?$ If he is justice... then not even one Christian can be spared... if Christians are to be killed.$ Empress, have mercy.$ Poppaea is right, Marcus.$ I'm afraid it's impossible.$ It must be possible, Caesar.$ This must be made possible to me.$ No faithful subject would ask it.$ I do ask it.$ And Nero has no more loyal subject than I.$ You, Empress... who knows better than you that I have been faithful to the Emperor?$ I have the right to ask.$ I have obeyed and honored you.$ I have risked my life in your service.$ And all that I shall ever ask for it, a small thing to you... is that you give me the life of this one girl whom I love, Caesar.$ With my whole heart, I plead with you to spare her.$ No, Marcus.$ We do not want barbarians laughing at Roman justice.$ This thing I ask is justice.$ To achieve it, I will take steps to move the world of Caesar.$ I demand that you spare this girl!$ Marcus!$ You've gone too far.$ Seize him!$ Nero.$ Nero beloved.$ Love has made him insane.$ Caesar, forgive me... but spare this girl if you have any compassion.$ Caesar is compassionate... but he is also justice.$ I must remain justice, Marcus.$ If only she weren't a Christian.$ Marcus... if she would publicly renounce her faith...$ Not even then.$ If she renounced, then justice can be merciful.$ I can't stay any longer, Marcus.$ But Caesar, she will not

A place of rest.$ - That's it.$ The secret graveyard of the elephants.$ Somewhere to the east, there's a mysterious barrier of mountains... called the Mutier escarpment.$ And the natives won't say where that Mutier escarpment is.$ It's sacred.$ Taboo.$ If one of them is found even to have looked at it... he's put to death by the witch man of the tribe.$ Now, Holt and I believe... that beyond that Mutier escarpment somewhere... lies the burial place of the elephants.$ You do?But why?$ Of course.$ Ivory.$ Enough ivory to supply the world.$ There's a € 1,000,000 for the man who finds it.$ -

They're like evil ghosts.$ - Those are the Ubangis... one of the most feared and courageous tribes.$ Yet they're afraid of the Mutier escarpment.$ It may not be fear.It may be superstition.$ To some of them, the elephant is sacred even alive.$ How much more so in death?$ - Have they gone?$ - Far enough.$ One good turn deserves another.$ He'll tell us now.$ Come on, get up.$ He's dead.$ Anyone would die who look at Mutier escarpment.$ Poor fellow.$ - He died too soon.$ - Did he?$ I wonder.$ He was crazy with fear, yet he managed to point.$ And that's the direction in which he pointed.$ And that's the Mutier escarpment, eh?$ Yeah, and all we've got to do now is climb it.$ Mother Earth must have some very particular secret up there... putting up a wall like that.$ Here.$ -

you said you couldn't understand why he was so interested in us.$ Do you think he did this?No.$ No, I think his natives would.$ Natives would be right.$ Of course if you want to, we could go to Beaumont's house first.$ If I could get my hands on the devil that's responsible for this,I'll make him such an example that every witch doctor in Haiti would be shaking in his sandals.$ But we can't do this alone.$ Can't the authorities help?$ The authorities, Neil, my boy, you don't know these islands.$ The native authorities are afraid to meddle.I am not.$ I've got friends among the natives.$

3941571$ LAND WITHOUT BREAD$ This film was shot in 1932 soon after the founding of the Spanish Republic.$ The region we are going to visit is called Las Hurdes.It's barren and inhospitable and man is forced to fight for subsistence.$ The first road to las Hurdes was built only in 1922.$ Before that, it was unknown to the rest of the world and even in Spain.$ On the way to Las Hurdes, we pass La Alberca.It's a bit more prosperous, but still feudal.Almost all the inhabitants of Las Hurdes are in debt to this town.$ The church at La Alberca.$ Two skulls in their niches symbolise the town's destiny.$ Most homes have three storeys.$ This is rare in Spain and gives the streets a medieval aspect.$ Many homes have a religious text over the door:$ " Ave Maria, conceived without sin."$ The day we arrived, the women were dressed in their finery.$ Why were they dressed so beautifully?$ They said they were going to the plaza for an annual ceremony that's strange and barbaric.$ Newly wedded men gather.Each must take up the head of a rooster.$ A rope extends across the street.On it hangs a rooster tied by the legs.$ The men gallop by and try to catch a head.$ After parading in triumph with the heads the grooms offer everyone wine.$ It's a time for enjoyment.$ In the crowd, a baby adorned with silver medals.$ They are like amulets from Africa or Oceania.$ By 7 pm almost everyone is drunk.$ 3 kilometers away, from a hill top we look down on the 52 villages of Las Hurdes.They have a total population of ten thousand.$ Down steep slopes to the valley of the Batuecas inhabited by a solitary monk and his maid.$ For centuries this has been home to monks of the Carmelite order.They preached Christianity in the villages of Las Hurdes.$ Batuecas has a rich prehistory.$ Skilful cave paintings representing men, goats and bees.$ Toads, snakes and lizards are now the only inhabitants of these ruins.$ Rich vegetation with more than 200 species of trees.$ Yet 5 kilometres from this fertile valley there are almost no trees.$ Just a few fruit trees, rockroses and heather.$ The convent is surrounded by an 8 kilometer wall.It protects from attacks by wolves and wild boar.$ Inside are the scattered ruins of 18 hermitages.Each is marked by a cypress or two.$ Beyond here..... lies Las Hurdes proper.$ We are entering the barren lands of Las Hurdes.$ The village of Aceitunilla is in one of the poorest valleys.$ The white building is the school, built recently.$ On its sloping streets we encounter daily life.$ Strange, but we never heard anyone singing in Las Hurdes.$ A miserable rivulet runs through the village down from the hills.$ In summer, water in scarce.The villagers are obliged to use this filthy water.$ Strange things go on here.$ The rivulet serves many purposes.$ Three children eat a slice of bread dipped in water.$ Until recently bread was almost unheard of here.$ It was given them by their teacher who makes the children eat in his presence fearing their parents will take it from them if they take it home.$ The children are summoned to school.$ These ragged, barefoot urchins receive the same education as children the world over.$ Clothing is brought back by Hurdanos who leave each summer for Castilla and Andalusia.$ They go there mainly to beg.$ When they return, they exchange clothing for potatoes.$ These hungry children are learning algebra.$ In some villages of Las Hurdes most of the children are orphans.$ They are abandoned children whom the women of Las Hurdes bring back from Public Assistance in Cuidad Rodrigo a two-day walk away across the hills.$ The women raise the children in exchange for 15 pesetas a month.$ This miserable sum is enough for an entire family..... until the not-so-distant day when the practice is outlawed.$ An unexpected and shocking picture we saw in the school.$ Who could have made this absurd engraving?$ We opened at random a book of maxims we found on a table.$ One of the best students writes on a slate one of the book's maxims.$ It's the same the world over:" Respect other people's property!"$ In this relatively fertile valley there are some walnut, cherry and olive trees.$ This is the village of Martilandran.$ The shapes between the trees, resembling the shell of some mythical animal are just the roof tiles of the village.$ Entering the village, we are greeted by a chorus of coughing.$ Most of the villagers are ill.$ It's a scene of devastating misery.$ The principle disease here is goitre.$ Look at this woman with her goitre:$ She's only 32 years old.$ We visit the village in the company of the mayor.$ On an empty street we see a girl.$ We ask the mayor what's wrong with her.$ He tells us the girl's been there 3 days without moving.$ She must be sick.$ One of us goes up to her to find out what's wrong with her throat.$ He asks her to open her mouth.Her gums and throat are inflamed.$ Sadly there's nothing we can do for her.$ Two days later we returned to the village.$ We asked after the girl and were told she had died.$ What do the people of this sterile land eat?$ Almost the only food here is potatoes and beans, and then not always.$ Especially in June and July there's not enough food.$ The only meat is pork.$ But only the wealthier families have a pig.$ Once a year a pig is slaughtered.$ The meat lasts three days.$ Olive trees grow in more fertile spots.$ But the olives are usually eaten by insects.$ The best animal for such infertile land is the goat.$ Its milk is reserved for the gravely ill, who mop it up with bread brought from afar by the beggars, and given only to the sick.$ Goat meat is only eaten when a goat dies.This happens from time to time on the steep slopes.$ The main industry in Las Hurdes is apiculture.$ But most of the hives don't belong to the Hurdanos.$ And the honey the bees get from heather is very bitter.$ The owners of the hives are from La Alberca.$ They only let the Hurdanos have the hives in winter.It's milder here than in the neighbouring province of Salamanca.$ In spring they take the hives to Castilla.$ Then, it's common to see pack animals laden with hives heading for Castilla.$ One day, we came across a donkey laden with hives.Two Hurdanos are taking it to Salamanca.$ Later, while we were eating, we were asked for help.$ The donkey was tied up and one of the hives had fallen.$ It was being attacked by bees.$ It tried to defend itself but more hives had fallen.And swarms of bees had descended on it.$ An hour later it was dead.$ A month before our arrival three men and eleven donkeys had died the same way.$ May and June are the hardest months in Las Hurdes.The potatoes have run out.$ The villagers eat unripe cherries.It gives them dysentery.$ This is when the exodus begins.$ All the able-bodied men who don't have a fever head for Castilla or Extremadura to find work in the fields.$ We came across several of these caravans: of 10, 30, 50 men.They were carrying only a blanket.$ They have neither money nor bread and they are going on foot to find work.$ We came upon another group several days later.They were returning as they'd come, without money or bread.$ How do the Hurdanos prepare the land to grow their crops?$ First they choose a spot close to the riverbank.Then they cut down the rockrose and heather.$ Their tools are rudimentary: pickaxe and shovel.$ These are the only tools they have.$ The plough is almost unknown.$ Once the plot has been cleared they put up stone walls, without mortar.$ The wall will protect the plot from winter floods.$ One the wall is up, they have to look for fertile soil in the hills.$ They put it in sacks and carry them through the brambles to their plots.$ This usually takes several weeks.$ A thin layer of fertile soil now covers the plots.$ The first year sees an abundant harvest, but then the soil is exhausted.There's no nitrogen and it turns sterile.$ All the plots in Las Hurdes are thin bands beside a river.$ Winter storms can destroy the work of a whole year.$ A characteristic winding river in Las Hurdes with tiny plots beside it.$ With no money or domestic animals. the Hurdanos have no fertiliser.$ They have to go up into the hills to look for it.That's what this family is doing.$ The way is hard and footwear is scarce.$ The best fertiliser is made by the Hurdanos themselves from the dry leaves of the strawberry tree.$ They fill their sacks with the precious leaves.$ But there are many snakes hereabouts.$ This villager was bitten a few days ago while collecting leaves.$ The bite itself is hardly ever mortal.$ But, by trying to cure themselves, the Hurdanos sometimes die.$ Having collected their leaves the villagers return home.They spread out the contents of their sacks indoors.$ People and animals alike sleep on the leaves.$ The leaves gradually decompose.And, several months later:... they can be used as fertiliser.$ A house in Fragosa.$ A bed of leaves extends from the doorway.Every home in Las Hurdes is like this.$ A typical interior.$ The utensils are primitive and few.$ The smoke escapes where it can.$ There's no chimney or windows.$ In summer the water courses run almost dry.This leads to malaria brought by anophelese mosquitos.$ Almost everyone in Las Hurdes has malaria.$ A battle against the disease is being fought by doctors in the three" Trading Posts" of Las Hurdes.$ The larvae have to rise to the surface to breathe.$ If it stays parallel to the surface it's anophelese.$ If it stays perpendicular, it's a culex larva: and harmless.$ The adult anophelese is found in every home.$ See how it rests perpendicular to the wall.$ The outcome of an anophelese bite.$ This man has a fever.$ We encounter many sick people in the streets.$ This sick woman on a balcony is unaware of our presence.$ Balconies are rare in Las Hurdes.$ There are many dwarfs and cretins in Las Altas Hurdes.$ Their families usually employ them as goat herds.$ Some are dangerous.$ They flee from other people or attack them with stones.$ They are found at nightfall in the hills as they return to their village.$ We found it very hard to film them.$ The realism of a painting by Zurbaran or Ribera is nothing to reality itself.$ The degenaration of these people is caused mainly by hunger lack of hygiene, poverty and incest.$ The shortest person here is 28 years old.$ An older cretin.$ We were only able to film these virtual savages with the help of a friend from Las Hurdes, who acted as intermediary.$ One day we saw a group of people in front of a doorway.$ A child has just died.$ The mother.$ A death is one of the rare events in these miserable villages.$ The women gather at the house of the deceased.$ It's hard to transport a corpse.Most villages don't have a cemetery.$ They have to take this child to the cemetery in Nunomoral.We decided to follow.$ The body was placed on a trough and carried for several miles through the thickets.$ If the dead person is an adult the body is tied to a ladder and carried to the cemetery.$ It's a journey that can take hours.$ Crossing a river with a corpse.$ Despite the misery in which the Hurdanos live their moral and religious sense is the same as anywhere else in the world.$ Each grave is indicated by a cross.Or by a piece of wood.$ The only luxuries in Las Hurdes are the churches.$ This is in one of the poorest villages.$ A better-off home.$ Father, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.$ The paper cut-outs on the wall add a touch of interior design.$ In some villages, a woman roams the streets at night.$ She announces deaths.$ She rings a bell and stops to pray.$ Everyone lives in a single room.$ But this home is a little more comfortable.$ There's a stable on the ground floor and upstairs a kitchen and living space.$ There's even a bed.$ In winter, the Hurdanos sleep fully clothed.$ The wear their clothes until they wear out.$ This woman says:$ " Nothing keeps one awake more than thoughts of death...$ " Or reciting an Ave Maria for someone's soul."$ We left after two months in Las Hurdes.$ The misery shown in this film is not without remedy.$ Elsewhere in Spain, hill people, peasants and workers have achieved better conditions through mutual self-help.They have made demands of the authorities for a better life.$ ... will give impetus to the coming elections and lead to a Popular Front government.$ The military rebellion backed by Hitler and Mussolini seeks to bring back the privileges of the rich.But the workers and peasants of Spain will defeat Franco and his cronies.$ With the help of anti-fascists from all over the world civil war will give way to peace, work and happiness.And the miserable homes you saw in this film will disappear for ever.$

in short, exposure to fright and horror often triggers insanity.$ Perhaps the most interesting case of such pathological conditions is the case of Dr. Mabuse.$ Here he goes again.$ I shall briefly recount the history of this case.$ The patient lived a decidedly double life.$ He was a renowned doctor with a large private practice.$ Aided by an almost superhuman logic, he used his profound knowledge of hypnosis to commit crimes of a magnitude previously deemed impossible.$ For months the police sought the mastermind behind those crimes, the man behind the curtain.$ At last they discovered his whereabouts.$ But Mabuse decided not to flee but rather to mount armed resistance, and he barricaded himself in his house with four loyal henchmen.$ He refused demands to surrender to state authorities, saying," I am the state!"$ A barrage of bullets forced the police to retreat.$ Finally, soldiers stormed the house with hand grenades.$ Two of the defenders were killed.$ Two were captured.$ Mabuse, however, had disappeared.$ One prisoner revealed his hiding place:$ a counterfeiting lab from which he planned to launch a massive attack on the German currency system.$ The police force their way in to seize him only to find he had gone hopelessly insane.$ Judging by his incoherent remarks, he had seen, during the previous night, the ghosts of all those he had slain.$ Apparently it was the horror of that experience that overpowered this phenomenal mind, which for so long had straddled the fine line between genius and madness, and literally deranged it.$ Mabuse was committed to an insane asylum and to this day has not spoken a word to anyone.$ Silent and motionless, he remains in the position you see here.$ The patient withdrew into his own ego, depriving us of any glimpse into his inner life.$ But suddenly the clinical profile changed.$ We observed that Mabuse's hand continuously made writing motions in the air, on the wall and on the bedspread.$ We gave him pencil and paper.$ At first, he covered the paper with senseless scribbling.$ Two years ago, however, certain words began to appear on the paper.$ Then, sentences began to form, still meaningless and confused.$ Gradually they grew more coherent and logical, and at last we began to get glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was his mind.$ His thoughts still move in the same criminal channels as before.$ Whatever Mabuse writes is based upon incontrovertible logic and serves as a perfect guide for the commission of crimes worked out to the minutest detail.$ No.$ Nothing can happen to us if we follow the doctor's methods.$ - Oh, yeah?$ - What do you mean," oh, yeah"?$ The first attacks on the snitch failed.$ So what?$ Tough luck.$ So we called in Division 2-B to handle the matter.$ If they succeed, fine.$ And if they don't -

96 hours -I lay up there at the air vent, and now I know who's behind it all.$ But you'll probably think I'm crazy.$ Who is it?$ I swear I'm telling the truth.$ I know who's behind it all!$ I heard his name with my own ears!$ And now they know I know the name.$ My God!The lights have gone out!$ Lohmann, help me, for God's sake!$ Can you trace that call?$ For God's sake!$ Hofmeister!$ What street?$ Number 23?$ Thanks.$ GloriaLovely are the maidens in Batavia$ Dear God.$ He must have gone out of his mind from terror.$ A pathological condition that is not as rare as one might suspect.$ Exposure to catastrophes such as explosions, earthquakes and railway accidents - in short, exposure to fright and horror often triggers insanity.$ Perhaps the most interesting case of such pathological conditions is the case of Dr. Mabuse.$ Here he goes again.$ I shall briefly recount the history of this case.$ The patient lived a decidedly double life.$ He was a renowned doctor with a large private practice.$ Aided by an almost superhuman logic, he used his profound knowledge of hypnosis to commit crimes of a magnitude previously deemed impossible.$ For months the police sought the mastermind behind those crimes, the man behind the curtain.$ At last they discovered his whereabouts.$ But Mabuse decided not to flee but rather to mount armed resistance, and he barricaded himself in his house with four loyal henchmen.$ He refused demands to surrender to state authorities, saying," I am the state!"$ A barrage of bullets forced the police to retreat.$ Finally, soldiers stormed the house with hand grenades.$ Two of the defenders were killed.$ Two were captured.$ Mabuse, however, had disappeared.$ One prisoner revealed his hiding place:$ a counterfeiting lab from which he planned to launch a massive attack on the German currency system.$ The police force their way in to seize him only to find he had gone hopelessly insane.$ Judging by his incoherent remarks, he had seen, during the previous night, the ghosts of all those he had slain.$ Apparently it was the horror of that experience that overpowered this phenomenal mind, which for so long had straddled the fine line between genius and madness, and literally deranged it.$ Mabuse was committed to an insane asylum and to this day has not spoken a word to anyone.$ Silent and motionless, he remains in the position you see here.$ The patient withdrew into his own ego, depriving us of any glimpse into his inner life.$ But suddenly the clinical profile changed.$ We observed that Mabuse's hand continuously made writing motions in the air, on the wall and on the bedspread.$ We gave him pencil and paper.$ At first, he covered the paper with senseless scribbling.$ Two years ago, however, certain words began to appear on the paper.$ Then, sentences began to form, still meaningless and confused.$ Gradually they grew more coherent and logical, and at last we began to get glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was his mind.$ His thoughts still move in the same criminal channels as before.$ Whatever Mabuse writes is based upon incontrovertible logic and serves as a perfect guide for the commission of crimes worked out to the minutest detail.$ No.$ Nothing can happen to us if we follow the doctor's methods.$ - Oh, yeah?$ - What do you mean," oh, yeah"?$ The first attacks on the snitch failed.$ So what?$ Tough luck.$ So we called in Division 2-B to handle the matter.$ If they succeed, fine.$ And if they don't - if it looks like that snitch might rat on us - one single phone call and this whole place gets blown sky-high.$ Stop scratching, Fritzi.$ It won't come to that.$ Before that guy can open his mouth, he'll be done for.$ I'd feel better if they didn't resort to murder.$ What do you mean, murder?$ A guy can have something fall on his head, can't he?$ A nice, clean little accident.$ I don't care how you make it look.$ I just don't want anything to do with murder.$ Scared?$ Can't bear the sight of blood?$ Let me tell you something, though it's really none of your damn business.$ I've killed two people.$ I know what it means to kill.$ And that's precisely why$ I want nothing to do with murder.$ Leave him alone, Fritzi.$ What do you know about Kent?$ The phone!$ Yeah?$ It's been taken care of?$ Bravo!$ Really?$ Just 20 minutes later?$ Lohmann himself?$ Continue writing.$ Hofmeister himself has disappeared.$ The rug has been moved toward the window.$ He was on the phone when the lights went out.$ Where's the light switch?$ -

something.$ Turn out your toes as you walk and always say" Your Majesty," and so forth.$ If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.$ Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.$ Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.$ I'm sure I'm very sorry.$ I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.$ Would you tell me, please?$ You've begun wrong.$ The first thing in a visit is to say,$ " How do you do?" And shake hands.$ I hope you're not much tired.$ Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.$ So much obliged.You like poetry?$ Yes, pretty well.$ Some poetry.$ But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?$ What shall I repeat to her?$ The Walrus and the Carpenter is the longest.$ " The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might$ " He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright$ " And this was odd because it was The middle of the night$ " The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand$ " They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand$ "' lf this were only cleared away' They said,' it would be grand'$ "' lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year$ "' Do you suppose,' the Walrus said$ "' That they could get it clear?"'$ "' I doubt it,' said the Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"$ "' Oh, oyster, come and walk with us,' The Walrus did beseech$ "' A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'$ " They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each$ " The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said$ " The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head$ " Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed$ " But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat$ " Their coats were brushed Their faces washed$ " Their shoes were clean and neat$ " And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet$ "' The time has come,' the Walrus said' To talk of many things$ "' Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"$ "' And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'$ "' A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said' ls what we chiefly need$ "' Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed$ "' Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'$ "' But not on us,' the oysters cried Turning a little blue$ "' After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!'$ "' The night is fine,' the Walrus said' Do you admire the view?'$ "' I weep for you,' the Walrus said' I deeply sympathize'$ " With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size$ " Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes$ "' Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter'You've had a pleasant run$ "' Shall we be trotting home again?' But answer came there none$ " And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"$ Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.$ But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood because it's really getting very dark.$ Well, goodbye.$ Look!$ Do you see that?$ It's only a rattle.$ Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.$ I knew it was.$ It's spoiled, of course.$ My nice new rattle.$ Of course, you agree to have a battle?$ I suppose so.$ Only she must help us to dress up, you know.$ Of course!$ " Tweedledee and Tweedledum Agreed to have a battle$ " For Tweedledee said Tweedledum" Had

tying string.$ All this has got to go on somehow or other.$ This is to keep my head from being cut off.$ You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle is to get one's

It's getting very, very dark.$ And darker and darker.$ What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!$ Why, I do believe it's got wings.$ It's the crow!$ The crow!$ May I put your shawl straight for you?$ I don't know what's the matter with it.$ It's out of temper, I think.$ I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.$ It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.$ And dear me, what a state your hair is in!$ Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.$ And I lost the comb yesterday.$ There, now you look better.$ My finger's

it all over again?$ I suppose so.$ Well, it's a bit lighter now.$ I'm glad that crow is gone.$ I hope your finger's better now.$ Better, better, better.$ What is it you want to buy?$ I should like to buy an egg, please.$ I never put things into people's hands.$ That would never do.$ You must get it for yourself.$ What a strange egg!$ It keeps growing much faster than it should!$ Curiouser and curiouser!$ It's bigger than a chicken!$ Why, it's...It's Humpty-Dumpty!$ Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.$ Tell me your name and your business.$ My name is Alice.$ It's a stupid enough name.$ What does it mean?$ Must a name mean something?Of course it must.My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.$ With your name, you might be any shape.$ Why do you sit out here all alone?$ Because there's nobody with me.$ Did you think I couldn't answer that?$ Ask another.$ Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?$ That wall is so very narrow.$ Of course I don't think so.$ Why, if I ever did fall off, which there's no chance of, but if I did...$ If I did fall, the King has promised me...$ To send all his horses and all his men.$ Ah, so, you know.$ All his horses and all his men.$ They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.$ However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.$ Let's go back to the last remark but one.$ I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.$ In that case, we start afresh, and it's my turn to choose a subject.$ How old did you say you were?$ Twelve years and four months.$ Wrong.$ You never said a word like it.$ I thought you meant," How old are you?"$ If I'd meant that, I'd have said that.$ Twelve years and four months.$ An uncomfortable sort of age.$ Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.$ What a beautiful belt!$ Or is it a beautiful collar?$ It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.$ I know it's very ignorant of me.$ It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.$ It's a present from the White King and Queen.$ Is it really?$ They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.$ I beg your pardon?$ I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.$ I mean, what is an un-birthday present?$ A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.$ I like birthday presents best.$ You don't know what you're talking about.$ How many days are there in a year?$ Three hundred and sixty-five.$ And how many birthdays have you?$ One.$ And if you take that from 365, what remains?$ Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.$ Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.$ Certainly.$ And only one for birthday presents.$ That's glory for you!$ I don't know what you mean by glory.$ Of course you don't, till I tell you.$ I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.$ But glory doesn't mean that.$ When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.$ The question is whether you can make words mean different things.$ The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word?$ That's all.$ However, I can manage the whole lot.$ Impenetrability, that's what I say.$ Would you tell me, please, what that means?$ I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.$ Fancy it meaning all that.$ You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.$ Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?$ I read it a long time ago.$ I can, but I won't.$ That's all.$ Goodbye.$ Goodbye, till we meet again.$ I shouldn't know you if we did meet.$ You're so exactly like other people.$ The face is what one generally goes by.$ That's just it.$ Your face is the same as everybody's.$ The two eyes, so.$ Nose in the middle, mouth under.$ Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.$ It wouldn't look nice.$ Wait till you've tried.$ Watch out!$ Help!Help!$ I'm falling!$ Tell the King!$ Tell him to bring his horses and his men!$ Help!$ What happened?$ We ran into each other, Your Majesty.$ Good.$ I rather fancied something like that had happened.$ Oh, Your Majesty, Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!$ I know, I know.$ Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.$ Two without horses.$ If all this King's horses and men can't put him back together again, nobody can.$ I'm glad Humpty will be all right.$ I was worried.$ Well, don't be.$ Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.$ I see nobody on the road.$ Oh, I only wish I had such eyes!$ To be able to see nobody, and at that distance!$ It's too, too bad!$ Can I help you, sir?$ On or off?$ You are on.$ In a short time I shall be off again.$ I'm so sorry.Are you the King's messenger?$ I am the White Knight.$ I see you're admiring my little box.$ It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.$ You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.$ But the things can get out.$ Do you know the lid is open?$ Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.$ Can you guess why I did that?$ I can't imagine.$ In hopes some bees may make a nest in it.Then I should get the honey.$ But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.$ It's a very good beehive, too.$ One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.$ That other thing's a mousetrap.$ I suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out.$ I don't know which.$ It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.$ Not very likely, perhaps, but I don't choose to have them running all about.$ You see, I'm well provided for everything.$ That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.$ What are they for?$ To guard against the bites of sharks.$ It's my own invention.$ But let's go on.$ I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.$ I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.$ Only the usual way.$ That's hardly enough.$ You see, the wind is so strong here.$ It's strong as soup.$ Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?$ Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.$ I should like to hear it very much.$ First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.$ Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.$ Things never fall upward, you know.$ It's my own invention.$ You may try it if you like.$ I'm a great hand at inventing things.$ Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up,$ I was looking rather thoughtful.$ You were a little grave.$ Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.$ Would you like to hear it?Very much, indeed.$ Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it.$ I said to myself,$ " The only difficulty is with the feet.$ " The head's high enough already."$ Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.$ Then I'm over.$ Sir Knight!$ If there were only a gate down here,I'd be in excellent position to cross it.$ How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?$ What does it matter where my body happens to be?$ My mind goes on working all the same.$ In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.$ In time to have it cooked for the next course?Hmm.$ That was quick work.$ Well, not the next course.$ In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.$ What did you mean it to be made of?$ Well, it began with blotting paper.$ That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.$ Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.$ And here I must leave you.$ This is the end of the wood.$ You've only a few yards to go.$ Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.$ At last!$ But you'll stay and see me off first?$ I shan't be long.You'll wait?$ Of course I'll wait.$ I think it'll encourage me.$ Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.$ For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.$ The poor, dear Knight.$ He's the nicest person yet.$ Well, here I am.$ What's this?$ A crown!A golden crown!$ I'm a queen!I'm a queen!$ How dare you say that you're a queen.$ What right have you to call yourself so?$ You can't be a queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better.Be seated.$ Yes, Your Majesty.$ I'm ready, Your Majesties.$ Can you do addition?$ Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?$ I don't know.$ I lost count.$ She can't do addition.$ Can you answer any useful questions?$ How is bread made?$ I know that.$ You take some flour...$ Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?$ It isn't picked at all, it's ground.$ But how many acres of ground?$ I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!$ Oh, dear.$ You know any languages?$ What's the French for" fiddle-de-dee"?$ Fiddle-de-dee's not English.$ Whoever said it was?$ Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is,$ I'll tell you the French for it.$ Queens never make bargains!$ I'm so sleepy.$ She's tired, poor thing.$ So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.$ I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.$ I'll have to do it myself.$ Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap$ When the feast's ready we've time for a nap$ When the feast's over we'll go to the ball$ Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all$ Now that you know the words, sing it through to me.$ I'm sleepy, too.$ Now what am I to do?$ Do wake up.$ To the looking-glass world$ It was Alice that said$ " I've a scepter in hand$ " I've a crown on my head"$ No admittance until week after next.$ Why...Why, how dare you!$ Fill up the glasses as quick as you can$ And sprinkle the table With buttons and bran$ Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea$ And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three$ Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea$ And welcome Queen Alice With 30 times three$ Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink$ And anything else that is pleasant to drink$ Mix sand with the cider And wool with the wine$ And welcome Queen Alice With 90 times nine$ Mix sand with the cider And wool with the wine$ And welcome Queen Alice$ With 90 times 90 times 90 times nine$ You've missed the soup and fish!$ Serve the roast!$ You seem a little shy.$ Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.$ Alice, Leg of Mutton.$ Leg of Mutton, Alice.$ How do you do?$ May I give you a slice?$ Certainly not!$ It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.$ Remove the roast!$ Will you, won't you, will you, won't you...$ Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.$ May I give you some?$ Pudding, Alice.$ Alice, Pudding.$ What impertinence!$ How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?$ Make a remark.$ It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.$ Well...$ You'd better prepare.$ We're about to drink to your health.$ Queen Alice's health!$ Queen Alice's health!$ Queen

Oh, I don't get her at all.$ What does she do for a good time?$ She never goes out.$ Come on, boys.$ Try and give the appearance of working, anyhow.$ We've got to make a good impression on Mr. Trenholm.$ Oh, dear, I'm so nervous.$ All this fuss and excitement over Mr. Trenholm.$ I do hope he doesn't start firing people right and left.$ The last time the president came...$ When do you think the loan will be decided?$ Oh, possibly in about two days.$ Then I shall take myself to Nice for a much needed rest.$ Well.$ I didn't expect to find you here.$ - I know you didn't.$ - Miss Allen has done very well.$ We've put her in charge of our travel bureau.$ Really?$ I'm glad to hear it.$ Oh, by the way, this department has increased its business over 40 percent since the first of the year.$ - Going my way?$ - No, thanks.$ - Well, you don't know which is my way.$ - Anyhow, I'm not going that way.$ Well, good night.$ How are you liking Paris?$ Oh, it's very nice, except that you can't get a taxi when it rains.$ Could I drop you?$ - I'm afraid that would be too much trouble.$ Thank you.$ Frankly, I am surprised.$ Why?$ I didn't expect you to stick to the job.$ That's why I stuck.$ One might imagine that you'd find this business life rather dull.$ One might imagine that you know practically nothing about me.$ Still, it would have been easy for you to come here to Paris and have a somewhat gayer time.$ It would have been too easy.$ That's what you expected me to do.$ Does it annoy you to find out that you're wrong about something?$ Or were you ever wrong before?$ Well, you must admit that our first meeting was rather formal.$ Oh, this is as far as I go.$ So this is where you live, huh?$ All the charm of the Old World and the Old World plumbing.$ I'm sure your apartment is attractive.$ I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.$ - Thanks so much.$ Good night.$ - Good night.$ Oh, it's one of those pink envelopes.$ I knew it.$ These big executives always begin cutting down the office force.$ Oh, I never thought they'd let you go, though, dearie.$ -

How do you do, my dear?$ - How do you do?$ - Courtland, old boy.$ - Hello, Harry.$ Harry simply dragged me here with the delusion that Miss Allen might dance with him.$ - Do you know the Duke of Pom-plum?$ Courtland always finds the most devastating girls.$ But if you get bored, you come along, join us later.$ Oh, that would be jolly.$ Well, if I don't see you later, and I don't suppose I shall take me to lunch tomorrow, dear.$ - I will, Aunt Julia.$ Good night.$ Miss Allen, would you honor me with a dance?$ - Take Harry with you.$ - I've been looking forward to it.$ - Come along, you little man.$ Good night.$ - Good night.$ - Good night.$ - Good night.$ Well, my evening's a social success.$ Dukes and ladies.$ Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie.$ You mustn't be snobbish.$ Beneath their rough exteriors, they really have hearts of platinum.$ Are you really thinking or just pretending to?$ That's the nice part of being with a mastermind you do the thinking for both of us.$ Then you're coming to Deauville?$ Deauville's too crowded.$ How about Biarritz?$ -

Bride of a lamb"?$ Young lady who was going to marry Dr. Strike.$ I found our famous safe - conduct pass in her pocket.$ Say, this isn't anything to laugh at.$ We gotta get rid of her pretty quick.$ We've had enough trouble with that guy Strike.$ I think you have underestimated the good doctor.$ He seems to have excellent taste in some things.$ Yeah, never mind that.$ I'm not gonna wait to put any boat in commission.$ She goes back to Shanghai tonight if I have to send her back in a freight car!$ Jones, Jones, Jones.$ I'm afraid gallantry is not one of your vices.$ Open the door.$ MEGAN:Open the door.$ MAH-LI Good morning.$ Are you better?$ MEGAN:Where are we?$ What is this terrible place?$ This is General Yen's summer palace.$ General Yen?$ The bandit?$ Good morning.$ I hope you slept well.$ Oh, I'm sorry.$ YEN:It was terribly stupid of me to disturb your morning like this.$ But there is a famine in my province, and I have no rice to feed my prisoners.$ I assure you it won't happen in the future.$ They are taking the rest of them down the road, out of earshot.$ A cigarette?$ I have both Turkish and Virginia tobacco.$ I've never heard anything so cold-blooded in all my life.$ But isn't it better to shoot them quickly than let them starve to death slowly?$ Don't go, please.$ Please sit down and have your breakfast.$ Why did you drug me on the train?$ I don't remember a thing.$ You were in great pain, and sleep makes a long journey very short.$ You didn't have to bring me here.$ Why don't you send me back to Shanghai?$ I intend to, but it isn't safe to send you back by rail.$ Please sit down.$ I don't believe you.$ You're lying.$ I'm sorry, but you are making a mistake.$ Dr. Strike told me all about you.$ You yellow swine, if you think that...$ I advise you to send me back to Shanghai just as soon as you can.$ You will always find me your most humble servant.$ Did you see this?$ What are you laughing at?$ Ten to one she goes back to Shanghai in a freight car.$ You lose.$ She's not going back at all.$ Are you nuts?$ Do you want that guy Strike to turn your province upside down?$ Haven't you seen the Shanghai newspapers?$ They think she's dead.$ I think I'll shave.$ Say, wait a minute, wait a minute.$ Wait a minute.Listen.$ I've never interfered in your private affairs before.$ But don't forget, this is a white woman.$ That's all right.$ I have no prejudice against her colour.$ Well, it's no skin off my nose.$ Come in.$ Good evening, Miss Davis.$ General Yen...Sends his compliments and humbly requests the honourable presence of Miss Megan Davis for dinner for the third time.$ And for the third and last time, Miss Megan Davis says no.$ Mah-Li.$ Were you able to send that note to Dr. Strike?$ Yes.$ Do you think you could send another?$ I want to make sure he gets it.$ Maybe.$ This is all I have left.$ Can you do it with that?$ Maybe.$ Here.$ Mah-Li, I'll never forget this.$ Speak English.$ What did she say?$ She said," No, for the third and last time."$ Well...$ I often envy the common soldier.$ His wants are so few.$ Even a common soldier would've knocked.$ I did.$ I almost broke the door down, but you didn't hear me.$ You were evidently absorbed in the sublime effects of the spring moon upon my people.$ What do you want?$ In my province, this is called a cherry-blossom moon.$ It's a time when young and old, rich and poor, sick and sound pay their homage to the god of love.$ You think you can wear me down, don't you?$ But you can't.Do you hear me?$ You can't.$ Oh, please let me go.$ I can't stand this any longer.$ Please send me back to my friends.$ But I have told you:$ The country's in state of war.$ If anything should happen to you,I have to answer to Dr. Strike.$ How long will it be?$ I don't know.$ Maybe a week, maybe a month.$ Maybe even longer.$ But I will do everything I can to make your visit pleasant.$ If you would only relax and let me improve our acquaintance.$ It's pretty hard to become acquainted with a man who ruthlessly slaughters helpless prisoners in one move, and in the next shows such a tender reverence for the beauty of the moon.$ You have the true missionary spirit.$ Really, Miss Davis, there are times when I would like to laugh at you.$ But there are also times when I find you admirable.$ There are also moments when I...$ Perhaps I shouldn't speak of them.$ I might astound you.$ Perhaps you believe us incapable of such moments.$ Yes, I'm sure you do.$ Have you ever read our poetry, Miss Davis?$ Do you understand our music?$ Have you ever seen our paintings of women walking among fruit trees?$ Where the fruit trees look like women, and the women look like fruit trees.$ There has never been a people more purely artist, and therefore, more purely lover, than the Chinese.$ I think we ought to end this discussion.$ Certainly, if you find it objectionable.$ But I wish you didn't.$ If you should change your mind, if you would follow our custom of accepting third invitations, we are having dinner at 8.$ MEGAN:Yes?$ I will give you more suitable gifts later.$ Why?$ That was Captain Li.$ Oh, that's all right, Mah-Li.$ You don't have to bribe me.$ Then you won't tell the general?$ It's nothing to me.$ If you want to do something for me, help me get out of here.$ Escape?$ Isn't there some way you could persuade him to send me back to my friends?$ He would only think I was jealous.$ But it would be easy for you to do it yourself after dinner.$ Please come.$ You could help me so much with Mr. Jones.$ Jones?$ An American?$ Yes.$ The general's financial advisor.$ What kind of a man is he?$ Oh, he's very smart.$ I'm afraid of him.$ Could I meet him?$ Yes, if you come down to dinner.$ This dress of mine looks terrible.$ Oh, I can arrange that.$ Do you like this one?$ I like that one.$ I have noticed you were in need of powder and paint.$ Yes, perhaps I am.$ I will see you at dinner.$ Thank you.$ YEN:Oh, Miss Davis, I'm so glad you changed your mind.$ This is Mr. Jones, my financial advisor.$ Hello.How's the missionary racket?$ And this is Captain Li, my aide.$ Please.$ You're a newcomer in China, I take it?$ Yes, I landed four days ago.$ You're learning an awful lot about China in four days.$ I certainly have.$ No.$ No champagne?$ That's Pol Roger, 1906.$ I wonder if I could have a glass of water.$ Water?$ You'll catch your death of typhoid.$ Your health, Miss Davis.$ And the same to you, Mrs. Yen.$ Oh, that chair is for my wife... who does not exist.$ As yet.$ JONES:You see, Mah-Li isn't his wife.$ She isn't even allowed to sit on the same level with us.$ She may seem kind of lonely tonight, but I've seen her with plenty of company.$ Excuse me.$ I was greatly relieved tonight when I heard there was another American in this strange place.$ Well, thank you for the compliment.$ But I guess I'm what's known in the dime novels as a renegade, and a darn good one at that.$ I don't think I'd be much of a relief to anybody.$ What's that?$ Oh, I was just trying to find out the duties of a financial advisor.$ He's the secretary of my treasury.$ Yeah, I'm the big squeeze.$ And if I do say it myself, I can milk more money out of this province than any man alive.$ Do you advise the general on other matters too?$ Sure I do.$ But he never takes it, except when it comes to money.$ Then he's all ears.$ Aren't you, general?$ Well, as they say in your country," Money talks."$ JONES:Money talks in any country.$ Wait till you hear how that boxcar full of money I've got out there is gonna talk.$ Six million dollars Mex can make a lot of noise in any language.$ I thought you asked me not to mention that, Jones.$ We're all friends here.$ Besides, Mah-Li knows anyway.$ I didn't tell her.$ You're not the only man around this ranch who tells her things.$ JONES:We play dealer's choice, Miss Davis.$ Stud, jackpot, spit-in-the - ocean, roodles.$ Anything you like.$ I'm sorry, I haven't any money.$ I'll be glad to carry you.$ It's only a friendly little game.$ No, thanks.$ I think I'll watch.$ JONES:How about you, general?$ Pass.$ Two bucks.$ And $ 10 more.$ Not me.$ I thought you said you passed.$ I'll raise you $ 10.$ And $ 10 more.$ He loves to steal a pot.$ Don't pay any attention to Jones.$ He has a bad liver.$ Oh, don't try to kid me, general.$ Don't I know you better than you do yourself?$ Him and me, thick as thieves.$ Don't you tell me everything you know?$ Do I?$ And if you don't, don't I know how to find it out anyway?$ I don't know.Do you?$ Sure I do.$ All I have to do is give $ 50 to the general's bodyguard.$ You give too much.$ Sometimes I give more than that.$ Five hundred dollars Mex to Captain Li and you can get the low-down on whatever happens around here.$ How many cards, please?$ Two.$ And how does Captain Li know?$ You better ask Captain Li about that.$ How pretty.$ Do you know good jade when you see it?$ Valuable as diamonds, jade like that.$ You like them?$ Look at them closely.$ Yes, they're lovely.$ I want you to keep them.$ They're yours.$ They're yours.$ Put them on and wear them.$ Oh, I couldn't think of it, really.$ I don't want them.$ But you must take them.$ I assure you, they are mine to give.$ Please take them.$ It was cruel of you both to humiliate her that way.$ It was disgusting.$ Nice girl, Mah-Li.$ Raised in a mission school, she tells me.$ She's charming, and I'm quite sure she's good.$ Hah!$ That's an idea.$ Now you're talking.$ What about this one?$ JONES:Come on, gigolo.$ Don't forget your rings, Miss Davis.$ How could you employ a man like that?$ Jones has everything I want of the Western mind.$ I don't follow you.$ It's very simple.$ As long as I can make my interests his interests, he is not going to betray me.$ But your Dr. Strike, he is unreliable as a friend.$ And also as a lover.$ He will betray you every time for his god.$ The subtlety of you Orientals is very much overestimated.$ I can't get the connection.$ East or West, men seldom deviate very far from their main passion in life.$ You might as well know once and for all that Bob Strike has everything I want, or ever will want, in a man.$ Put it on the table.$ MAH-Ll:Come in.$ Here are your rings, Mah-Li.$ But the general gave them to you.$ Well, I'm giving them back to you, general or no general.$ Miss Davis?$ Will you send them to my parents when you get back to Shanghai?$ They live in Xuzhou, and they're very poor.$ I will write the address.$ Why don't you take them yourself?$ That's impossible.$ Impossible?$ What's the general going to do with you?$ You've got a chill, Mah-Li.$ You go right straight to bed.$ I'll order some hot tea.$ No.$ Don't bother.$ See?$ I have my hot-water bottle.$ That'll keep me warm long enough.$ They aren't going to take me far.$ Goodbye, Miss Davis.$ Look here, Mah-Li.$ I've wanted to tell you from the first that if I could ever help you in any way, I would.$ That's what I came to China for, to help people.$ You are very kind, but I'm waiting for the guards to take me away.$ Guards?$ What guards?$ Where are they taking you?$ Not far.$ Oh, no, they won't.$ You stay right here, Mah-Li.$ I'll go and see the general.$ What's the idea, Miss Davis?$ Isn't it long past your bedtime?$ Is that any of your business, Mr. Jones?$ Now, you don't fool me even a little bit, young lady.$ Mah-Li's been spilling grief, and you're all steamed up with Christian charity.$ Then it's true?$ Sure it's true, but you keep out of it.$ Besides, the general's gone to bed.$ If you think I'm going to let that child be...$ Now, Miss Davis, maybe you think I acted pretty rotten tonight, but I know what I'm talking about.$ Mah-Li's not your kind.$ She's just a conniving, little dame who deserves every bit that's coming to her.$ Including murder, I suppose.$ Now, you let the general be the judge of that.$ He runs his own show out here, with about 50 centuries of authority back of him.$ You missionaries come out here and expect to convert 500 million people overnight.$ Why, changing a leopard's spots is duck soup compared to changing China.$ You know, you're lucky to be alive out here yourself.$ Now, you go back to your room, go to bed and behave.$ Not until I've seen the general.$ I'd like to see the general.$ Please, Miss Davis.$ Have a little common sense.$ You have no right to go to his room in that getup.$ Besides, I know the general is a nice fellow.$ He's well-educated, has lovely manners.$ But don't forget he's a Chinaman.$ If you're through, Mr. Jones, I'll do as I please.$ All right, young lady.$ It's no skin off my nose.$ Well, Miss Davis.$ What have I done to deserve the honour of your visit at this hour?$ You've ordered the murder of Mah-Li.$ Well, couldn't we speak of something more pleasant?$ Here I have some excellent brandy.$ It's supposed to be over 1,000 years old.$ Would you like to try it?$ You're murdering her just to satisfy a cruel, jealous revenge.$ May I?$ Mah-Li has been betraying military secrets to my enemies.$ Can't you silence her in some other way?$ Yes.$ In the old days, in the days of the Manchus...I could have had her tongue cut out.$ But now, since you missionaries have taught her to read and write, she's a constant menace as long as she's alive.$ I feel sorry for you, General Yen.$ A powerful man like you afraid of a poor little slave.$ The only way to get loyalty is to compel it.$ Take Captain Li, for example.$ He's the only son of a very powerful family which claims to support my rule.$ All right, I believe them.$ But as evidence of their good faith,I made them place him in my hands as a hostage.$ Now, if they would betray me, the life of Captain Li enables me to save my own face.$ That's the way we get loyalty in China.$ That's why China is 2,000 years behind the times.Don't you see...?$ Why are you so interested in Mah-Li?$ I'm just as much interested in you.$ Oh.$ I am deeply flattered.$ But not deeply moved.$ Can't you forgive her?$ She's only a child.$ You can always do so much more with mercy than you can with murder.$ Why don't you give her another chance?$ Oh, I know you feel that she has deceived you and sold information to your enemies, perhaps even been unfaithful to you.$ All that's dreadful.$ And if it's true, you have a certain justification in wanting to crush her.$ But I want you to think of all those things and then forgive her.$ I don't know how you feel about Mah-Li.$ I mean, whether you love her as...$ Well, as a lover.$ But that's of no importance.$ I want you to see the beauty of giving love where it isn't merited.$ Any man can give love where he's sure it's returned.$ That isn't love at all.$ But to give love with no thought of merit, no thought of return, no thought of gratitude even.$ That's ordinarily the privilege of God.$ And now it's your privilege.$ Oh, general, with all you have within you, your superior brain, your culture, how can you be so blind to spiritual greatness?$ Do this thing I ask you.$ Do it for me.$ Do it even blindly if you must, and I promise you, I'm so sure of it,I promise you that for the first time in your life you'll know what real happiness is.$ You'll know that I...$ I have one of my own.$ That's what you said to me that day.$ You must be sincere, Miss Davis.$ I don't believe a word you say.$ But when you ask me like that, I forget I am General Yen.$ Then you won't have her killed?$ But I ask myself, what do you get out of it?$ You've hardly known her more than a few days, and still you act as if she were of your own flesh and blood.$ She is.$ We're all of one flesh and blood.$ Really?$ Do you mean that?$ Of course I do.$ Words.$ Nothing but words.$ You came in here to preach.$ Not my words.$ The one who first spoke them gave up his life for them.$ What are you willing to give up for them?$ What do you mean?$ Surely your pleasure wouldn't be complete without some sacrifice on your part.$ Sacrifice?$ Yes.$ You are so interested to save the life of Mah-Li.$ Are you willing to be a hostage for her future loyalty?$ Like Captain Li?$ I expect nothing from you.$ Nothing but words and phrases you learned in Sunday school.$ You don't believe in them any more than I do.$ You were wrong when you said I resent missionaries.$ I despise them.$ There should be another Great Wall to keep your kind out.$ You've already got a Great Wall around you.$ And it isn't built of mud and stones.$ It's made of ridiculous pride and inhuman cruelty.$ You won't allow one single human feeling to reach you.$ You want me to be hostage for Mah-Li?$ All right.$ I'm not afraid of you.$ I'll answer for her loyalty.$ JONES:Say, what the sam hill is going on here?$ Come here, Mah-Li.$ I'm going to spare your life.$ Are you off your nut?$ Get up.$ Thank her.$ I'm going to place you in her hands.$ She agrees to answer for your future loyalty.$ But you know and I know, the moment my back is turned, you're going to throw a knife into it.$ Miss Davis, I swear I'll never betray your trust.$ I swear by my father's head and by the bones of my ancestors.And by the holy book in the mission school.$ I believe you, Mah-Li.$ What are you up to now?$ I am going to convert a missionary.$ Here's your slipper, Mah-Li.$ You're so kind.$ Now, I want you to promise not to see Captain Li again as long as we remain here.$ Anything you say, Miss Davis.$ Will you take me to the temple today?$ What, again?$ I want to have prayer of forgiveness read.$ See?$ I've written it while waiting for you.$ I'm so proud of you, Mah-Li.$ I knew you were a good girl.$ Certainly I'll take you to the temple.$ Come on.$ Here.$ I couldn't sleep.$ I had to get up.$ We gotta get this money train out of here.$ I got a hunch, and I always follow my hunches.$ Between war and women, the general's got me about nuts.$ Come on, open up there.$ Hello, Mr. Jones.$ I want you to take train away from here.$ Bayside Station.$ Money no safe here.$ Money no safe here, now.$ Yes, sir.$ Hide train, other place.$ Chop-chop.$ Tonight?$ What's that?$ No train due here now.$ I say, ever since this American girl came here, you've been off your nut.$ You wouldn't get rid of Mah-Li when I told you to.$ Well, now try and find her.$ Here, take a look at this if you want to see something.$ There it is, the whole works.$ Position of the money car, right down to what you had for breakfast.$ Where did you get this?$ Where do I get everything else around this dump?$ I paid a lot of money for it.$ You wanted to see me, general?$ Yes.Come in, please.$ Must've been important to have me dragged down like this.$ I'll say it's important.$ Where's Mah-Li?$ Isn't she in her room?$ No, she isn't in her room and she isn't anywhere else.$ What?$ You'll never see her again around this ranch.$ Thanks to you, she skipped out.$ I don't believe it.You'll believe it when we all pay for it with our necks.JONES:$ Did you ever see this before, Miss Davis?$ Why, yes.$ That looks like the prayer Mah-Li had read at the temple.$ Prayer?$ Prayer, my eye.$ That thing read in the temple?$ Why, there's enough dynamite in that to blow Yen's province into the Yellow Sea.$ There you are.$ Tie that.$ I told you, you were crazy to listen to these screwy missionaries.$ That will be enough.$ Everything is going to be all right.$ All right?$ Do you realise that your money's all gone?$ Money that I ground out of this province by the sweat of my brow?$ Now, the general and I and Captain Li were the only ones with that information.$ Now, how did Mah-Li get it?$ I'm to blame, general.$ That paper must've been in the shoe that I carried from Captain Li to Mah-Li.$ Oh, perfect.$ There you are.$ How long do you suppose your troops will remain loyal now?$ With all that dough, Feng will buy them out right under your very nose.$ You can say goodbye to this little empire of yours in about two days' time.$ That will be all, Miss Davis.$ You will remain in your room until you hear from me.$ That's a pretty fancy price to pay for what you're counting on.$ Oh, calm yourself.$ Conquest of a province or the conquest of a woman.$ What's the difference?$ Oh, yeah?$ There's one thing we should be grateful for.$ What's that?$ We finally got some skin off your nose.$ Oh...$ Come in.$ Well, Miss Davis.$ You certainly gummed up the prettiest setup I ever saw.$ I had visions of making General Yen the biggest thing in China.$ But you sure queered that beautifully.$ I hate your insides, Miss Davis.$ But you're an American.$ We got to stick together now.$ Where's the general?$ The general's all washed up.$ His army's deserting him as if he had the leprosy.$ Darned if I'm not even out of cigars too.$ Yes, sir.$ He could've been the biggest thing in China.$ One thing you've got to say for him.$ He sure can take it on the chin.$ Darned if I don't believe he isn't glad this thing happened to him.$ Oh, come on, now.$ Don't you get to worrying.$ I'll get you out of this somehow.$ I've been in tougher spots than this before now.$ You go on, get your things together.$ Wait here till I come back for you.$ Here, here, what's this?$ You tell the general she's busy now and can't see him.$ JONES:Here, wait a minute.$ You don't have to see him.$ Here, wait a minute.$ Now, I'm warning you.$ Your sportsmanship is magnificent.$ Won't you sit down.$ Please.$ You're just in time to help me select my portrait.$ Did you ever see a book like this?$ It's a painter's catalogue.$ The idea is to select the features that most resembles one.$ For example, ear number three... and nose number six... and the chin number 27 equal General Yen.$ How do you like this nose?$ Do you think it resembles mine?$ Perhaps you wonder why I don't sit for the picture myself.$ You see, a Chinese is never painted... until he has joined his ancestors.$ May I offer you some champagne?$ May I?$ In the days of our greatest civilisation, we drank to excess.$ In fact, one of my ancestors, a very famous poet, was drowned in an attempt to catch the moon in the Yellow River.$ Oh.$ This portrait is of his wife, who was made very unhappy by his death.$ She left a very famous collection of swords.$ I have them in my bedroom.$ May I show them to you?$ Oh, please.$ Why do you torture me?$ I am afraid you misunderstood my purpose in sending for you.$ I'm not altogether a fool.$ You didn't think I meant the conventional thing, did you?$ Didn't you?$ Do you think General Yen could accept anything that the heart did not freely give?$ Oh, no.$ That opportunity has been open to me ever since you came here.$ It was your life you put up as a forfeit for Mah-Li's loyalty.$ My life?$ Yes.$ What else did you think it meant?$ Oh, I see.$ You are afraid of death as you are afraid of life.$ You want me to send you back to your Dr. Strike?$ He speaks the same meaningless words as you do.$ He has everything you want.$ You would like to be able to boast to him that the

driver.I'm being annoyed!$ Now listen, Lola, Sugar.You wouldn't let me cut your appendix out without ether, would you?$ I got it on you there.$ I had mine out long before my voice changed.$ Charge it, please.All right, Miss Burns.$ Argh!My loving wife!$ Oh, what kind of a rib is this?$ Rib?Rib!That's it!$ - I came from Peoria.$ - Oh, please.Oh.$ Say, baby.We oughta get going.We don't wanna get caught around here.$ Aw, she will get back for hours.$ And anyway, if she doesn't like it, she can...$ Well?$ Some of my friends just dropped in for a little drink.$ Where's Pop?$ I gonna see him right away.$ He hasn't been here all evening.$ What's the matter, did his gang drink up all the bourbon?$ Just because I'm in your room was no reason for you to insult my friends.Listen.$ I got to find Pop and get $ 3000.Is there that much in my checking account?$ Since I'm not trusted in your financial affairs, I can't say –$ Well okay.But I know that you're taking pretty good care of my wardrobe.$ Loretta, you know they have beds of their own in the sun porch.$ Yes, ma'am.But things is going on out there the last time I looked.$ Come on, trio.$ Oh, hello, baby.$ What's the matter?I got I have $ 3000 right away.$ Three thousand dollars?$ I can't find Pops anyplace.$ I'll see you that he pays it back to you in the morning.$ What for?Well, I – I –I couldn't call on anybody but you, Jim.$ My brother's in trouble in Tijuana.I've got to send it to him tonight.$ Oh sure, a check will do.$ Although, Jim.I'll send Loretta for it in a cab.$ Thanks.$ I'm in an awful hurry, Jim.Goodbye.$ - Loretta, call a cab.$ Lola really means this?$ Precisely, sir.$ And I'm with her to the hilt.$ Poor harassed little child.$ I insisted that she write this letter immediately.$ Just a minute.$ The Burns company isn't working today, is it?No.$ Sir.Tell Mr. Hanlon to come in right away.$ This is disgraceful, Gillette.$ Hugo comes from a noble family –As for Lola, on my side, she's descended from everything back of Edward the 9th.$ You mean the eighth, don't you?$ There was no ninth.$ Yes, of course, a slip of the tongue in my excitement.$ Morning, AC.How are you, Pops?$ Well, we got everything in but your picture, Pops.But you know, the funny papers don't come out till Sunday.$ Remember our stand, Gillette.$ And with you, young man, I wouldn't waste my breath on you.$ That's right, Pops.Save it.Natural gas.$ Honest, AC, how are you?Doesn't it look pretty?AP sent out over 1000 words.$ But that's not so pretty.$ Binelli is no more her personal affair than one of those sheepdogs.That's a swell item about Burns.She's great copy because she don't know what she wants.$ And that's a story.She wants your job there.Sure it wasn't anything personal about it on your part?$ I do not get you, AC.$ - No jealousy connected with it?- Jealousy?$ Listen, AC.I'll smooth this whole thing out.For that I'm grateful little pirate.$ She wants my job, does she?After I got the whole country talking about her over their coffee cups this morning.?$ No actress got a break like that since the Dark Lady of the Sun sang mammy songs.$ Imagine that little Peoria cornflower trying to give me the runaround.Ha!But, Space –$ Don't worry, AC.$ Where I kick her, the camera will never pick up the scars.$ - Miss Burns in?$ - Yes, sir.$ What's the matter, Mr. Hanlon?$ It's, uh –It's my appendicitis.$ I'm sorry, sir.$ Miss Burns is in the drawing room.$ Thank you.$ Hugo, dear.Don't say things like that.But, Hugo.$ Your lawyer?Yes.My lawyer.$ You might be interested to know that Mr. Brogan's check was canceled to the bank.- Or did you know?$ I just want you to know that you are a cheap, little pebble.$ All right, if that's the way you feel about it.You big patent leather peanut vendor!$ I seem to be getting rid of a lot of people around here today.$ What are you doing here?$ I just – I just came to say goodbye.$ You win, Lola.$ Gillette fired me.$ I guess you can get another job all right.$ - People seem to think you're clever.- No.$ Once you're fired by Monarch, it sort of puts a tab on you in this business.$ But uh – what are you gonna do?I don't know.$ I've been wanting to get away for a long time anyway.China maybe, Australia, Tahiti, the South Seas.$ I guess that's as good a place as any to end things up.And be a failure.$ You mean like Gable did in Susan Lennox with all those sailors and women?$ Yes, I guess it won't be so hard to forget.$ Will you shake hands, Lola, before –$ What you mean, Space Hanlon?$ If you're clever enough to think up all those things about me, you've got better sense than to do a thing like that.$ You know – that's a funny thing – I –$ Before Gillette telephoned me this morning,I decided I'd gone too far with you.And I ought to change the type of stuff.$ - You mean give me nice publicity?$ - Sure.$ I got the first interviewer outside right now.I thought you might give her a couple of hours, since you're not working today.$ She's uh – from the Ladies Home Companion.$ Gee, that sounds nice, Space.$ Strictly women's stuff, you understand.$ Photographs too.You know, a story about you in your own home.Just your natural simple self.$ You mean, with me cooking?And my favorite recipes?$ Yeah, and walking in your little garden.And reading all your books.And giving advice to young girls.$ Well, you can see her if you want to, Lola.$ I just did it as my last official act.$ Do you mind – do you mind if I write now and then?$ Last official act?$ We'll see about that.$ Wait a minute, Lola.What are you going to do?$ Gillette could have at least discussed the matter with me.$ We all lose our temper sometimes.$ Now will walk, I don't want you to do that.$ You're a big star.$ And it just makes yourself look foolish.I'll do whatever I –$ Hello, Irene?$ This is Lola Burns.$ Is Mr. Gillette –?$ Well, when he comes in, tell him not to pay any attention to that letter I sent him this morning.$ It was a joke.$ You go to Tahiti?Why, you might get leprosy or something.$ Gosh, Lola, thanks.$ I don't know just what to say.$ I guess I'm kind of sh choked up or something.$ Shall I send in Mrs. Titcomb?$ You were right about Hugo.$ Any man who would say the things he said to me over the phone!$ He threatened to sue me!$ You find your true friends amidst adversity, Lola.$ Jim Brogan helped me.$ I called him up in the middle of the night.And he sent down the bail money. $ 3000.Without asking any questions or anything.$ Well, why not?I imagine that bluebird would just love to get you under a three grand obligation to him.$ Jim Brogan did that out of pure friendship.$ Any time Jim Brogan does anything out of pure friendship for a dame$ I'll call the undertaker.$ He's dead!Jim Brogan is a fine man.And besides, he's a genius.$ Will you stop telling me all that you know about him?$ Aw Sugar.What you see in that guy?$ I see as much in him as you see in Alice Cole!$ That's all over.$ Besides you wouldn't even know it until you come busting into people's office without knocking.Get out!$ Sure, I'll get out.$ I've got work to do.$ I don't lay down on my job.$ Over a little further, Miss Burns.$ - Like this?$ - Oh, that's fine.$ Now hold it....$ Still...$ That was sweet.Totally sweet.$ Hmm, that smells good.$ I just love baked potatoes, don't you?$ That's my last plate, Miss Titcomb.$ I just hate to go.But I think I have everything, don't you?$ Oh, do stay and have luncheon, Miss Titcomb.$ No, dear, I must dash off and start putting down the words.$ They're just itching at the tips of my pinkies.$ Such a dear little nest you have here.$ It is cozy.$ I imagine with your work, as fascinating and inspiring as it may be, you don't have much time to enjoy your own fireside, do you?$ No, our lives are dedicated to our public, Miss Titcomb.$ But tell me, dear.You're a woman.You're the sweet unspoiled child I knew you were.$ Don't you ever, in the midst of the grueling pace of your career,Doesn't there ever come a longing for – for the right of all womanhood?$ Let's see uh – you mean that, uh –?$ I mean, don't you ever find yourself listening for the patter of little feet?$ Oh, yes, Mrs. Titcomb.$ The call of motherhood is so strong in some women.$ The call of fatherhood in men too.$ Sometimes I think that was what killed Mr. Titcomb.$ Oh, well, we miss all bear the cross that's given us, I always say.$ Goodbye, my dear.$ Oh, don't let that studio work you too hard now.$ Goodbye, Mrs. Titcomb.$ " Au revoir," as the French say.$ Winters?$ - Have you ever had a baby?$ - No, miss.$ I never had anything but my married sister.$ Your hat, sir?I won't stay here long enough to take it off.$ Jim, it's you.Sure.$ I just dropped in on the way to work to tell you you can't make a sucker out of me.Why, Jim –$ I read the papers too, you know.$ That barber of yours can stay in the can, as far as I'm concerned.$ And I called up and canceled that check too.$ I only lied to you becauseI knew you wouldn't do any thing if I told you who was for.$ You see, I was trying to help somebody whom I thought was a friend.$ When the main, thought was a friend?$ He called me up and abused me frightfully.$ He said I did it purposefully for publicity.$ Sure, that's fine.Didn't I tell you that guy was a no-good immigrant?$ It's a closed chapter in my life.$ Besides, an American must be the father of my child.$ Hey, what's the matter with you?$ You're an American, aren't you, Jim?$ Well, I don't know, that's what they told me.$ Jim, I'm serious.Why don't we get married, like we should've done in the first place?Lola!$ And have lots of little babies.$ Say, what's got into you?$ What's the idea of this fancy dress costume?$ Jim, did you ever feel the call of fatherhood?Hey, wait a minute.$ I mean to create things.Life.To keep the world going on.$ Yes, the big one.$ I call her Fanny on account of her fantail.$ But the man at the bird store said that she was going to lay some eggs.Isn't that sweet?$ Why don't you go upstairs and lie down?$ Maybe that's the reason I've been so upset and miserable, Jim.$ Deep down in every girl's heart, there's a desire for the right of all womanhood.Beside her fireplace, with her husband and children around.$ Say, listen.You can't raise a family and make five pictures a year.$ Oh, look, Lola.You're just in a mood.And you're playing a scene with yourself.$ I'd like to have a camera turning on you right now.You'd be a sensation.$ Holy smoke.$ I got a story conference at 12 o'clock.But I'll be back just as soon as we're through.Because I've heard enough to know that it's gonna be Lola and Jim again.$ You just think you want a baby, that's all.Why don't you call up some orphan asylum?$ Tell them to send you one over on a 30 day free trial.$ Winters?$ It kind of gets you inside, doesn't it?$ I guess you sort of decided, eh, Miss Burns?$ Oh, he's beautiful.$ You're right next to me.And you're gonna stay there.$ Do you think his hair will be any lighter when he grows up?$ That's hard to tell.$ Wouldn't it be nice if he were a blonde?Then people'd think he was really mine.$ Yes that would be nice – if you were ever married.$ You know where you're going?$ You're going home with Lola.$ And I'm gonna get you a big blue bunny with pink eyes.Yes, I am.$ Before anything can be decided, Miss Burns, two of our committee members will have to call on you at your home.$ Really?Why?$ Well, were rather strict where we place these children.$ Could they come today anytime this afternoon?$ Well, I'll see.$ Guy, where have you been all my life, hmm?$ Now listen, Joe.We know, lady, but this is important!Call me back.$ Boys, boys, where is your etiquette?$ Is it true Lola Burns is gonna have a baby?We can't –Ha ha Ha.$ Why – Why don't you change your brand of narcotics?$ Is it true, Space?Every paper in town got the tip.$ Hospitals, doctors, everything.You can't –$ Ho ho.$ Why don't you grow up?$ You got your tongues hanging out over some loony rumor.$ Where are you going?$ I'm going over to her house and get a signed statement of denial.With her own lily white hands.$ Okay.We'll go over and have a look at her ourselves.$ Are you nuts or something?$ After last night's headline, she'd shoot the first reporter that she saw.$ Don't you know that Lola Burns can't have a baby?$ No.Why?$ It's not in her contract.Oh.$ Hey, Pop.Mac.Come look what I got here!$ Winters, take the dogs.Don't let them get my things.$ Daughter, Miss Mac's just been telling me your plans to adopt a thing –$ Pop, look, it's got blue elephants on it.Ohhhh.$ Four dollars for a –$ I don't approve, daughter.$ The added responsibility –$ Look at the little booties.Funny?And the little flannel jackets I got.$ Aren't they sweet?And the teddy bear.$ Let's go upstairs, everybody.I thought we'd turn the guest room into the nursery.$ And will move the furniture out now.So we can put his little crib and table in there.$ My daughter, you can't be serious about this.The added expense.It's –$ Wait till you see him, Pop.He's the sweetest thing.I bet you won't take another drink for a month.$ Where's Miss Burns?She's up in her room, sir.$ Oh, Mr. Hanlon, sir.$ About your appendix?$ Now when I had mine out –$ A fine time to talk about operations.$ I never sent for you.$ No, but what's all this – this tornado about you're gonna kick a bad pimento around the house, huh?$ You would try to be funny about it.$ Oh, do you mean –You mean it's true?$ Yes.$ And this is one thing I don't need any help from you on.$ Aw, gee, you poor kid.$ No wonder you've been so upset lately.$ Why all the sympathy?$ You don't have to keep a stiff upper lip with me.You know –Hey, listen.$ What's his name?$ That's all I want to know.Don't tell me it's that –$ Don't be silly.I don't even know his name yet.$ You don't know his name –?$ You know –Well, holy smoke.$ When you gonna find out?If it's any of your business, as soon as I adopt the baby.And get a good name to suit him.$ So you're going to adopt a baby?$ Well, I'm not gonna kidnap one.$ For a minute there, you had me thinking you were going in for independent production.$ I don't care to discuss it further.Listen.$ You can't adopt a baby.$ As if you or anyone else could stop me.$ Yeah, but that isn't your line.The fans don't want to see the It girl surrounded by an aura of motherhood.Leaning over a cradle.$ I dubbed you the Hollywood bombshell.And that's the way they like you.Men.$ Scrapes.Dazzling clothes.A gorgeous pinwheel personality.$ I thought you were going to change that type of publicity.$ I'm gonna change – well – That isn't what I mean.$ I mean your work.Long hours.$ Nurses will be bringing it up.$ A lot of other people in this business have happy, healthy babies.Oh, don't –$ Yes, Winters?$ The Fairfax home for –$ The two ladies from the committee will be here at four o'clock.Oh.$ So that's the reason for sweet and simple little automobile duster.$ You'll serve refreshments, Winters.$ Cocktails, miss?$ Certainly not.$ We'll have tea and take it on the sun porch.$ Oh, Winters, show Mr. Hanlon to the door.$ Okay, baby, you win.$ But I tell you one thing.$ This home with your family is about as fine a place to bring up the baby as an alligator farm.$ You stay out of this, Space Hanlon.$ I'm the only one who has anything to do with it.$ Don't try to do too much.$ Just remember to leave an extra order for the milk man in the morning.$ Is this 814 Linden?- Yeah yeah.$ You might not know it but there's something the matter with your telephone.$ The phone?There.$ I spoke on it just now.Work good.$ That's probably what happened to it.$ You confused it.Hello, Monarch.$ This is Hanlon talking.$ Get me Jerry Beyers, publicityIf he's talking to anyone else, bust in on him.Mmm-hmm.$ The telephone is a wonderful invention.$ Hello, Jerry?$ This is Space talking.$ Now listen.$ And listen fast.What's the name of that shyster lawyer Binelli's got?$ Randolph.$ Ben Randolph.He called here just five minutes ago.$ Okay I'm calling him next.$ Now get this.Tell those reporters in my office to meet me on the corner of the Burns block as fast as their very closed veins can get them there.$ Yokohama.If this show comes off, I'm going down in history.$ She makes a large salary.$ We should easily be able to get –$ Who wants him?$ Oh yeah?$ Well I'm just a friend that doesn't like to see a gentleman like the Marquis get kicked around.$ If you're gonna sue, you better lam out to her house right now.Because she's planning to leave for New York and Europe on the five o'clock train.Right.$ How do you do?$ I am Mrs Ward.This is Miss Talley.$ We've come to discuss the adoption.$ How do you do, my dear?Why, you're just a girl.$ What you come out to the sun porch?We can talk there and have tea.$ Tea is not necessary, Miss Burns.But of course if it's ready.$ From everything I heard, I thought you were a much older woman.$ Well, I do play rather experienced characters on the screen.Yes.$ I've only seen you in one of them.$ Rather warm weather for California, isn't it?$ Nothing to what it is in the East, I am sure.$ You must understand, dear.That we're only here because we must consider the placing of a child very carefully.$ Frankly, Miss Burns.The committee is a little dubious in your case.$ After all, you have figured in the newspapers in a not so, uh –$ This morning's headlines were not too, uh –$ Miss Ward.I'd only known the gentleman you mean a very short time.A merely social friendship, you might say.$ In trying to help him, I found out – well – I never want to see him again.$ Will you forgive me if I don't discuss it?$ Certainly, my dear.$ Just when did you decide to adopt a child, Miss Burns?$ I'm going to be honest with you.$ It was just this morning.$ Maybe it was just a whim then.$ But gosh, Mrs. Ward.When I held that little fella in my arms –And knew that he didn't have a home.$ And now –As for your immediate family, is there anyone besides your father?$ Yes, my brother.That's all.$ I'm so sorry he is in here.He's away on business.$ Your brother's just returned, miss.$ He's putting his car in the garage.Oh, I must run out and meet him.$ Will you excuse me?Well, of course.Certainly.$ Why you good for nothing –$ Now there's no use getting excited, Lola.$ Who are you?Where did you come from?Oh, you're Burns, aren't you?$ Your little brother ran across me crying my eyes out down in San Diego.$ It's awful lonesome down there when the fleet's in Honolulu.Oh, bro, please!$ This is little Nellie.$ She's a nice little girl.$ She'd be a good bet for pictures.$ I want to introduce her to Gillette.You can't come in here now, either of you.$ I'm stealing home...$ Hey, I got some nice people.Some ladies in there.$ I love the ladies.And ladies love me!- Take him upstairs the back way!$ - Come, Junior.$ Gimme some of that dough.Gimme some of that dough.Come, Junior.$ A little rest will do you good.$ You keep him upstairs.You stay up there too.$ I'll explain everything later.$ You mustn't mind her.She's a little upset.$ We're all very hospitable here.$ I'm so sorry.But my brother asked to be excused.He's completely worn out by his trip.$ Oh, poor boy.$ Really, Mrs. Ward.Not a 100th of the stories they print about me are true.$ It's what the publicity man at the studio thinks is good publicity.$ But I told him this morning I wouldn't stand it any longer.$ And you're quite right, my dear.$ I'm just my natural simple self.With my dogs and my books and my fireside.$ Hey, Lola!Where are you, baby!$ I took the afternoon off.What do you say to tie you to the shaker of a cocktail.?$ - Why, it's uncle.- Darling, where is Abby?$ This is my Uncle Jim.Mr. James Logan.$ Mrs. Ward and Miss Talley.$ He always comes in that way.He's such a joker.$ You big meanie, why didn't you bring auntie with you?$ - What the –?- Now none of your excuses, uncle.$ You know how I wanted to see auntie.$ What you mean by coming in here shooting off your face like that for?$ Who are those dowagers in there?$ They are two ladies from the foundling home.$ How do you think I'm ever going to adopt that little baby when you come in here broadcasting like a sailor?Now, listen, Lola,.$ You're not really serious about that, are you?Yes.$ Oh, he's beautiful.$ I saw him today.$ He's got the cutest little button nose.And the tiniest little mouth.$ So those three sheepdogs and that brother of yours are not enough, huh?$ You don't understand, Jim.Oh, now listen, Lola.$ If you're really that serious, let's get married.Oh, no, Jim!No.$ Oh, you changed your mind since this morning.What's the matter?$ Oh, it's different now.$ It's gone beyond anything fleshy.- This little baby –$ - For the love of –Lola, listen to me.$ I think if we let him rest a while.Yeah, sure.$ I want to look this joint over anyway.$ I have a small gaming room in the basement.$ I'm staying out of basements.$ I was born in one.$ Along this wall, we have a few of our ancestral portraits.$ Is that the aunt, do you suppose?$ - Just a minute, boys.$ - How about it?Where is she?$ Listen, you Navajos.I told you there was nothing to it.$ She laughed in my face.Won't even discuss it.$ Looks like the laughs are on you.$ He drives for old lady Ward.$ She's in there with another dame talking to Lola about adopting a kid.$ Oh, that.What's the great news value about anybody adopting a kid?$ With Miss Burns, it's worth a column.$ Maybe it's a role she has farmed out for a while to cover up.$ Say, why don't you take the mud out of your –$ Hey, look who's here!Hey, Marquis?$ What you know about a baby?How about a statement?$ Yeah, what about American jails?$ Answer nothing, Marquis.$ There will be a signed story later.$ You look like you're headed somewhere, Hugo.$ I'm headed for Miss Burns with my lawyer.$ I shall then call upon Mr. Brogan.- And later, I shall come to see you.- Oh.$
