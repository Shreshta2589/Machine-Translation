6337723$ 'I have a responsibility, as a documentary photographer,'to photograph the times we live in, what the world is about now.$ 'Particularly, in America, it is about the big chain shop, about the big sort of Wal-Mart or whatever.$ 'My job is to try and capture what's going on.$ Now, if you get a great photo as well, that's a bonus.'$ 'I look out and say," I think there's something to be done here."$ 'It tends to be places where no other photographers I know ever thin there's anything worth doing.'$ The American photographer Garry Winogrand once said that he took photographs to see what the world looked like photographed.$ Photographers have always had this as their mission statement, but the three decades from the 1950s onwards were the real golden age of photographic journeys.$ Fuelled by existential restlessness, baby boomer wanderlust and cheap petrol, the photographers set out for new territories to see what these worlds looked like photographed and this is what they discovered.$ The desert.$ The open road.The city street.$ The beach.$ The suburban nowhereville.The man-altered landscape.$ These are the places that photography owns and this is the story of the journeys photographers made to claim them.$ Photography always wanted to be on the move even before the technology was really up to it.$ When Timothy O'Sullivan penetrated the deserts of the American west in 1867 he brought his dark room with him, pulled by four mules.$ Around the same time, the Bisson Brothers employed 25 porters to haul their equipment up the face of Mont Blanc, processing fragile, glass plate negatives in a dark room tent thousands of feet above sea level.$ The technology has come a long way since then, but any photographic journey worth making still demands blood, sweat and tears.$ They say that Timothy O'Sullivan was a master at profanity and I can believe it, the actual physical work of getting out is often fairly arduous, it involves a scramble, it involves risking snakes and swatting at the bugs.$ So it is a struggle, but when you get to the top of the ridge, you've got a whole new scene to work with, and it's thrilling.$ It's the greatest satisfaction you're gonna have all day.$ So, no, it's... it's the view...$ stupid.$ It's an excuse to be in the world really.Not just looking, that's the crazy part of it, it's being in the world.$ This is something I do, I take walks with my camera.$ I'm reminded of things I didn't even know I knew, for instance, because some...$ I have known this field for the last 45 years and there's something about this field that I've always loved.$ Isn't this wild?Shit!$ This is what I was telling you about before.$ That's part of why I'm interested in this field, cos I'm gonna photograph nature in all four seasons.$ And then these sky divers coming down deus ex macchina, you know?$ It's sort of like...$ Oh, here he comes!$ There, he's in the frame now.$ The history of photography is made up of journeys great and small, some as epic as a continent, some no longer than a city street...$ .. but few have been as influential as one taken by Robert Frank.$ It produced a book of photographs that laid bare the soul of 1950s America.$ The seminal person absolutely after the war is Robert Frank.The Americans is one of the most extraordinary paper movies that's ever been made.$ Born in switzerland to Jewish parentage, Robert Frank brought an outsider's perspective to bear when he embarked on a nine month road trip of his adopted home in 1956.$ Frank got a Guggenheim Fellowship to travel around the United States and document the kind of culture that he saw evolving here which he believed was spreading elsewhere.$ He started in New York, travelled south to South Carolina, then onto Texas, to California, then back to Chicago, and finally ending up back in New York.$ There was a continuity to the way he travelled - it's not the hop, skip and jump of the world travelling Cartier-Bresson.He got in a car, he saw the whole thing and he shot every place.$ Frank's journey produced the photographic equivalent of the great American novel, laying bare the anxieties that the chrome and the advertising jingles obscured.$ Though he'd been trained in a Swiss tradition that aspired to photographic perfectionism,$ Frank's free-wheeling odyssey echoed the spontaneity of abstract expressionist art and beat poetry.$ He doesn't give a damn if the verticals are straight up and down, because he's standing in the middle of the picture he takes off, and Jackson Pollock stands in the middle of the paintings he makes too.$ Again it's the kind of zeitgeist of abstract expressionism, that freedom, that release from the conventions of picture making that were earlier is there with Frank.$ Kerouac described it, I think, what he did - he called Frank's qualities agility, mystery, sadness, genius and secret strangeness.$ I think those really are the qualities that are there everywhere in those images.At the end of his road trip, Frank had nearly 700 rolls of film.$ He brought his final selection to the french publisher Robert Delpire, and they designed a photo book that would become one of the foundation stones of modern photography.$ He came back to me with a selection and we very quickly did the layout of the book.People always imagine you need two or three weeks to do that.We did it in one day.$ We spread the whole book out on the floor, as you did at that time, on all fours.$ As there were no double page spreads, just one picture after the other, we quickly agreed how the photos should be displayed, and that's how we did it.$ He doesn't want you to be distracted by the book - he doesn't want you to look at more than picture at a time.$ He doesn't want the eye to jump around.He wants you to take each one in so that as you turn the page that retinal retention will superimpose one picture on the next one.$ Frank wants you, as with a movie projection, to be going through at the same speed so the subtlety of the pictures is what will make the movie, not the mechanical push / pull of the design of the book.$ He gives structure very, very cleverly by starting each chapter with an American flag.$ And it's the flag that obscures the human face.From the very first image in the book, the flag is more important.$ Along with the American flag, there is a series of crosses, hidden, coded into it all the time.$ There's a picture of a Jehovah's Witness and behind him in the stonework is a cross so that he becomes a crucified figure.$ So you've got those two symbols as the basic grammar of the book, and it becomes the story of flags and hats and cigars and jukeboxes.$ And you realise the whole book is a narrative, a kind of narrative of optimism that's died, the show is over, and Frank understands that beautifully.$ The book appeared in France in 1958, and a year later in America with an introduction by Jack Kerouac.$ The critics hated what later generations of photographers came to revere.TRANSLATED:$ It was badly received, something you doubtless know.It didn't go down well in America where the critics said,$ " Who is this insignificant Swiss descending on the Americans,$ " coming to explain to them that the' American Way of Life'$ " isn't as extraordinary as people say?"It was like that.We lost money.$ But it wasn't that big a deal.The kind of book that I do loses money all the time.So I wasn't surprised.$ As if the corrosive poetry of Robert Frank wasn't bad enough,$ America also had to contend with the anarchic energy of William Klein.$ OK, let's go.$ I have exactly six minutes.If Frank is a Moody Blues, then, then Klein is Bebop.$ I mean his rhythm is a lot faster.$ What else do you want to know?$ How much money I make?$ Yeah.He's always on the offensive.$ Being aggressive and trying to provoke a situation and being absolutely fearless.$ Klein came back to his native New York in 1954 after a six year sabbatical in Paris where he trained as an artist, but this was no prodigal's return in sackcloth and ashes.$ How did New York strike you when you went back?$ How did it strike me?Right between the eyes.New York was shitsville, you know?$ wasn't such a big deal.Can we say on TV that he said he wanted to give America a kick in the balls, cos that's what he said!America's so full of shit.$ For a photographer of Klein's aggression and energy, there was one perfect outlet - the street.$ Photography discovered its inherent subject in the street.The landscape photographers and the portrait photographers were, in some ways, more stymie because there was an enormous tradition there that they were trapped in.$ But the photographers who worked on the street were willing to wing it, to risk it, make amazing discoveries.$ My photographs were, you know, given to the corner drugstore and they came back, you know, thumb marks, smudged and out of focus.$ I said" That's typical.That's the kind of photograph I took."$ But when I had access to a dark room and enlarged the photographs myself,$ I realised that the photographs weren't all that bad and you could do something with them.$ I could frame them differently, I could print them differently and so on.$ That was the first time I realised I could do something with photography.$ The street had always been an alluring place for photographers, but to start with, at least, it had proved to be elusive.$ Pioneer photographers could record the architecture easily enough, because it kept still, but the life of the street moved too fast for the long exposure times.$ In this Paris street scene by Louis Daguerre only the shoeshine man and his client stayed still long enough to leave a trace.So the first street scenes show artfully staged set-ups..... or what look like post-apocalyptic ghost towns.$ Gradually, the technology caught up.$ Citizens evolved from blurs to all too solid flesh, but the camera's struggle to keep pace with life on the streets left a rich legacy.$ It is a language of stutters and stammers, but Klein made it eloquent.$ I like this photograph, it's maybe one of my favourite photographs because I didn't know what I was doing.$ I was in the suburbs somewhere, in some waste land, and these kids were fooling around and I said," Dance."$ And it's only the next day that I realised I like get this kind of blur, a Picasso-like hand, a kid that some TV guy once said," Oh, I like that kid with the beard."And they danced.$ And that's what I like about photography.You can overexpose and underexpose.You can make everything cockeyed,$ but it's not something you would do if you're drawing a portrait or painting a portrait.$ And that's what's interesting in photography, it's the accidents.$ You can think of Klein as perhaps the first pop photographer.$ Klein isn't interested in the image in itself, but he's interested in the way this image can be arranged, cropped, put in different context.$ He considered them as raw material.$ Everyone is a kind of actor in front of William Klein's lens, everything turned into a kind of show.$ Did people mind when you took their photograph?$ Oh, they loved it.This is New York, you know?$ There used to be a programme called King For A Day and in New York everybody thought somebody was gonna call them up and say,$ " Hey, Mr Zeus Bum, how would you like to be king for the day?"$ Klein had acquired his first camera in a card game at the age of 18, a casual acquisition that would characterise his whole approach to photography.$ Trained as a painter in post-war Paris, he felt no respect for photography's sacred cows.$ I didn't really dig the French photography, you know, all these photographers now everybody reveres like Doisneau and even Cartier-Besson, completely chic and polite and sentimental, romantic and humanistic.$ So I said," Well, fuck that."$ Klein's idea of a photographer was Arthur Fellig alias Weegee the Famous, the legendary New York tabloid photographer.$ I dug Weegee.$ He had a police radio in his car and he'd go running to the police station, he'd photograph all these dead Mafia people and so on.And he had this big 4x5 camera and a big cigar and a big, big mouth.$ But he was a real New York icon, and he was great.$ He's very fond of taking pictures of crowds in all kinds of situations - crowds looking at car accidents, crowds looking at movies.$ He identifies with the crowd very strongly.And they are not reserving their emotions.They're not trying to be cool.$ He just happens to be one looking at them and poking a camera in their direction.$ I saw two kids playing cops and robbers and I said - one of them had a gun$ - I said," Hey, look tough."$ It's so much inside the camera range that it's out of focus.$ There's a child in profile also who's sweet and also quite confused-looking and much more intimidated by the whole situation.And this kid is a little caught in the crossfire.$ What I felt, at that moment, that it was a self portrait.Because I was this kid, and I was this kid.I was timid and afraid of everything, and then I was also a kid who came on pretty strong and I would get into fights and so on.$ So I was both.Great book maker.$ He is probably the most internationally influential of any single book maker.$ Frank would have never cut up pictures and put six on a page and some in ovals or anything, he would never have been that playful either.$ In the' 60s, it opened up for photographers around the world to do their city books with that energy.The one thing Klein had more than anything else is energy.He got New York too.$ I mean, he got the subject, it was the right city to have that degree of energy.$ To this day, the sidewalks of New York tempt the ambitious street photographer.$ Once you get the drift of it, and feel the energy of it, it makes you wanna go back again and again because it's where life seems to be.Going out to the street, being in this river of humanity and seeing unexpected incidents occur, how do you make the moment yours?$ How do you become courageous enough to step into the space and take the picture out of it and learn how to confront the oncoming flow of people and insert yourself into it.$ Joel Meyerowitz has spent 40 years answering these questions, ever since he threw over a career as an art director after seeing Robert Frank at work.$ I have a show coming up and we're publishing a book, and I've got to get this book out, and this is a dummy miniature images so I can make a maquette to see how the book works,$ and I've been actually working on this maquette for a couple of weeks.And if you see anything that you think I should change, you tell me.$ to start with, Meyerowitz's ambitions, like so many others, were defined by Cartier-Bresson's much imitated, much misunderstood theory of the decisive moment.$ At that time, I was interested in capturing an event because I didn't know any better and that was the language of the period... something happened in space and time, you try to be there and make an interesting shape, any picture about it.$ I saw myself as a visual athlete, you know?The ball comes!The glove is in the right place at the right time.$ For example, this is a catch picture, walking on the Pont Neuf or something like that and a man is walking his black and white Capuchin monkey and a woman's coming along with her... in black and white of all things... with her baby in there and the two of them are seeing each other.$ Or, you know, just catching a pair of giant shoes walking along the street with people in them, and they run into a girl on crutches who's got a leg in a cast and she does this high kick for them.$ Every camera has a clock on it.It says a second, it says 1 / 1000th of a second.$ And you can choose to work within those time constraints.And you actually can experience time.$ If you know 1 / 1000th of a second... you can begin to believe that you see things in that split second.$ And if you believe it, you'll begin to see it.$ One of the great lessons for me was having absorbed Cartier-Bresson's decisive moment, there came a point when I had to reject it.$ And re-imagine it somehow in New York.Cartier-Bresson's Europe had the sweet organisation of Parisian streets and parks and squares and the elegance of it and the scale of it.$ New York is sizzling with energy.$ Its skyscrapers and steel and glass and marble and it glitters and it's dynamic.But big as it is, and dynamic as it is, people are rubbing up against each other all the time.And they know each other's space.$ They can pass within inches of each other without touching.So it's full of beautiful possibilities, it's all this kind of bull fighting stuff that people do.And within that is the kind of sexy sense of intimacy.$ I mean, I like the idea of coming in real close to somebody, and by a gesture or a head turn, sort of dissuade them from thinking I'm photographing them.So their mindset says" He's not interested in me."$ And so they go blank to me.$ When Meyerowitz first began photographing in the early 1960s, 5th Avenue was a happy hunting ground for some of the greatest names in contemporary photography.$ Lee Friedlander and Diane Arbus worked these streets, as did Garry Winogrand who became a kind of pack leader for a generation of hungry young street photographers.He invited me to his place on 93rd Street on the West Side, said" Come on up sometime.$ I'll show you some photographs." So, great.$ I went, probably the next day, and what I saw was so astonishing.In his house there were stacks of photographs.$ If each of these boxes holds 250 prints,$ Garry had stacks that were about hip high.$ So that is probably 1,500, 2,000 prints in a stack and there was a stack here and a stack there and a stack...$ It was amazing to just flip through them.$ It wasn't that I saw a style or a technique but I saw the generosity and the spirit and I thought to myself' That's it, it's an appetite for life'.$ You couldn't feel sorry for yourself around Garry Winogrand, you just couldn't.$ When people would go on these trips and there's this whole sob story of going to Mexico and then," Oh, we got dysentery and then it was too hot" and it was this and it was that.$ " It sounds like you're talking about your own comfort."$ Which, in New York-speak is to say" Let's move on from there."You know?$ What does you own comfort have to do with anything?He was the Godfather in some ways.$ He was always driven.He was always obsessed.$ When I first met Garry, what I remember is sitting there, after he handed me these pictures he was smoking, he was drinking and he was shaking and tap, tap, tap - his feet were tapping on a chair, and his knees were shaking.$ He was like, he was this engine that was throbbing.$ It was a kind of nervous energy.Things responded to his energy.$ Photographers who photographed with him have said..... that things were always happening when he was around, and he'd stop to reload and they'd stop.$ And he'd be fully reloaded and ready to go and everything would start happening again.$ They are about a certain kind of male looking that does go on.But, at the same time, he also, I think, had a feeling for what kind of woman would respond more positively.$ Sometimes sexiness, but sometimes a kind of just bravado -" back at you, buddy."$ You know?" You wanna leer at me?" I can leer at you too," you know?$ " And I'm not, you know, I'm not embarrassed by being gorgeous and female$ " any more than you are by being, you know, overweight and a man."$ Winogrand found some of his richest raw material in the zoos of New York.$ When I first met Garry he was just going through a divorce - a separation and divorce - and he had two young kids.$ And on the weekends, in particular, he would take them to the zoo.$ And we'd just go and hang out with the kids.$ They would run around and, you know, look at the animals and Garry was looking at the animals.$ You could smile all through the book, they're animals, and you see them and then you stop and think, you know, they're heartbreaking photographs.$ It's a photograph of the European Brown Bear and it's a sign describing what the bear is and all you see of the bear, the bottom jaw of the bear, reaching up.$ This bear doesn't know he's European, he - he doesn't even know that he's a bear.$ And it's a totally heartbreaking act.$ In Central Park zoo Winogrand made one of his most famous and unsettling images.$ A lot of people when they first look at that picture they don't realise until the second or third beat that the guy hasn't got a bab, he's got a chimpanzee in his arms.$ They see the interracial couple and they go" Oh, my god, they've had a monkey."It's such an outrageous kind of a gag, which is like a bad racist joke.And that's exactly what Winogrand was aiming at and why he glommed on to moments like that.$ He liked to make pictures which he knew would make both the most liberal and educated and the most politically conservative people, make them both kind of upset.$ That discomfort, I think, is part of the energy that feeds the photographs.$ He did like to kind of startle people out of... what they thought was true.$ Among Winogrand's acolytes was the British photographer, Tony Ray-Jones.$ Ray-Jones had moved to New York to train as a graphic designer, but like his friend, Joel Meyerowitz, he'd been lured away from the drawing board by the siren call of the street.$ Jones' notebooks from the period contained the distilled wisdom of the 1960s street photographer.$ Be more aggressive, get more involved, talk to people, stay with the subject, be patient, take simpler pictures.Don't take boring pictures.$ in 1965 Ray-Jones returned home to see how lessons learnt in America could be applied here.$ But in the 60s, Britain was still what was once called" a right little, tight little island."$ For the unguarded subjects and spontaneous situations he needed, there was only one place for Tony Ray-Jones to go - the beach.The place that British photographers have instead of the street.$ The tradition of candid British seaside photography goes way back.$ In 1896 Paul Martin was in Great Yarmouth with a camera disguised as a brown paper parcel.$ The pictures he took showed the magic of the beach at work.$ Here at least it was possible to forget for a while what being Victorian meant.$ 70 years later Ray-Jones turned the beach into a psychiatrist's couch, the place where the nation reclined and bared its soul.$ Dreams of love.The damp disappointments of everyday life.The beach and the seafront were the stage on which these classic themes were played out.$ Going to the seaside was a journey back in time, in a sense, to a country which was still struggling to become modern.And that's what he wanted to find.Here was a place where you could record eccentricity and you could record some sort of essence of what people were about.$ There's a sort of abandon about the seaside, you know?$ Inspired by Frank and led by Winogrand, Ray-Jones and the other 5th Avenue photographers engaged directly with life on the street by turning the camera into an extension of their own personalties.$ In these pictures the photographer is always a sensed presence, a wry observer guiding the camera, making it see what he sees of the human condition and the human comedy.$ But left to its own devices, the camera can be nothing more than a slack-jawed dumb recorder of whatever is put in front of it, which is precisely what Ed Ruscha allowed it to be in a series of seminal books he produced in the 1960s,$ milestones in the history of photography and pop art.I mean, when I grew up, I just know that photographers were either nerds or they were pornographers.$ And so... there was no real redeeming social value to somebody who has a camera and takes pictures.$ But then as I started seriously working as an artist, travelling was essential, so I was continuously driving back and forth on US 66 between here and Oklahoma when I would take all these gasoline stations.$ Ruscha's 26 Gasoline Stations offered an alternative to the humanistic concerns of the street photographers.$ Not the human drama of the street but the taken for granted backdrop against which the drama plays out.$ I was after that kind of blank reality that that the subject matter would present.$ I was met with a little bit of scepticism from some people and usually those people were like... more intellectual, and a lot of those people... uh... were, would have this impression from this little product, that I was putting them on.$ Ruscha would go onto apply the same deadpan technique to parking lots seen from the air, and all the buildings on Sunset Strip.$ I photographed this two and a half miles of this area of Sunset Boulevard called The Strip.$ And this was done with an automatic camera mounted in a pickup truck.$ And what I was after is some kind of very democratic view of what this entire thing looks like.$ Not highlighting anything that is particularly... sociologically interesting or anything,$ I would give as much attention to a concrete kerb as I would a building.$ How long did it take to photograph all the buildings?Oh, this took about...$ a better part of a day to do this.$ You did it in a day?Mmm.$ Yeah.Oh, I've photographed all of Sunset Boulevard in one day's time.$ That's 27 miles.$ But the deadpan ironies of pop art were not the only new ideas in play in the 1970s.$ The biggest change of all came when some photographers began to see the world in a weird new way, in colour.$ At the time, colour photography was as shocking as Dylan going electric.$ It's hard to really place yourself back in that time but... it was heretical, it just... you didn't do it.$ I remember walking into a galleryist in New York City with my work in 1974 and he took a look and he asked me,$ " Why are you working in colour?" Black and white is so natural."$ Colour photography had been around since the 1860s but had flourished in the parts of photography's empire where commerce trumped art.Colour was found in advertising, fashion and glossy magazines - the places where photography sinned.$ By the 1970s, only SERIOUS art photographers saw the world in black and white.I had met someone at a party in New York.And we got to talking and he asked what I did, and I said I was a photographer.$ And he said," Oh, can I see your pictures?" And I opened a box, and as soon as I opened the box he said," Oh, they're in black and white." And he really... wasn't exposed to art photography$ " What's this convention about?"Serious photography was in black and white.Martin, you started in black and white.$ In the' 70s, it's what you did.Yeah.Or before.$ '60s,' 70s also was harshly expensive seeming.$ I mean, you had to have labs involved and you couldn't make your own decent prints.$ And it was sort of taken out of your hands when you did colour.$ For those able to shake off the convention, working in colour proved revelatory.Photography's about description.And so if the camera describes things, then don't you want an instrument that describes more things?$ And there's a certain moment$ I thought colour will describe more than black and white.$ When I switched to colour completely I had to work at slower speeds.Let's say 125th of a second or 250th of a second.$ In order to get the depth of field, I had to step back.$ When I stepped back, the content changed - it was no longer about something in the centre doing it, it was about everything.So it's about the tiger in the window.$ About the businessman entering the light.About the blind man and his dog wearing little leather booties.$ About this little cascade of women coming across the street with the tinkle of their beautiful legs in sunlight.It was about the incredible depth of space.$ I was trying to bring it altogether in a two-dimensional field.$ And I kept saying to myself at the time," These are field photographs.$ " They're overall.$ " I'm trying to work without a hierarchy of the catch in the middle" and then something else later on."$ This is an 8 by 10 inch camera.In place of the discreet portable 35 mm cameras, photographers turned to large format view cameras, big enough to capture the fine detail they now craved.So here's an 8 x 10 inch camera.$ And locks and then up comes the front.And you put a lens in there.$ It is the original voice of the medium.$ This is the way photography was born, which was a box with a lens on the front and light came in and went onto a piece of film, and this is the size of the film.$ So if you want authenticity and description and power, spatial power... this.$ Street photographers who'd spent the 60s shooting from the hip found themselves trying to keep up with the' 70s using 19th century cameras.$ but it was another piece of kit, which had been gathering dust in photographers' cupboards for decades, that really changed things.$ But I could hold a camera like this and, and kind of sway and the framing keeps changing.$ Here, this is where it is and then I can think about, and if I want to move it over, I pick it up and move it over a little, and it stays there.$ And I can go back and look at it, and think about that decision, and if I wanna crank it up, I can crank it up.$ It remembers your last thought.Yes, it remembers my last thought.$ not everything changed, photographers still made journeys out into the world to see what the world looked like photographed.$ Travelling conceptually, shooting in colour and often struggling with tripods and heavy view cameras, they sought out the extraordinary in the ordinary.$ What I wanted to do was to keep a visual diary of the trip.$ And started photographing every person I met.The beds I slept in.The toilets I used.$ Every meal I ate.Store windows.Residential buildings.$ And then anything else that came my way.And that became the.framework for, for that series.$ And so was it just Top 40 radio or wherever the local radio station was, religious stations and country and western stations and sometimes, to entertain myself, I would recite Shakespeare.$ And after a couple of days,I entered a very different kind of psychological state.$ I think it has to do with simply keeping my attention focused for hours at a time and watching this road passing.And I'm focusing straight ahead, and this world keeps passing by.And after a couple of days of this,$ I would be very energised and very clear and very focused.$ And that would go on for weeks.$ I can tell you what it was like.$ You know there I was in this used Volkswagen Camper.It seems like my tyres were always bald.I always had $ 40 and a bag full of sunflower seeds.$ Every day, from before dawn to after sunset, I was just fascinated.$ You know, I was only making two negatives a day, that's all I could afford.And you would think that your days would be empty, if you're only pressing the shutter twice, but every second was filled.$ Not everyone in the 1970s was braving the open road.$ One of the most influential photographers of the period was having his adventures closer to home.And you've got a fair number of folks.Yeah.$ for most of us, Memphis means Elvis Presley, but for photographers'the king' means William Eggleston.We think of Bill Eggleston, don't we?Yeah, we think of Bill.$ Do you think one day Bill's house will be open to the public?$ What do you mean?It isn't even open for friends now, I figure out when he's awake!$ Eggleston's reputation rests on the colour photographs he took from the early' 70s onwards of his home city Memphis and the surrounding area.$ The pictures caused a stir when they were first shown at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1976, and published subsequently in a book called William Eggleston's Guide.$ Inconsequential, indiscriminate and boring to some.$ To others, the guide is suffused with a strange, baffling beauty.$ Eggleston's pictures contain all the acute observation of a master street photographer like Winogrand, but their brightly coloured surfaces make them as unreadable as one of Ed Ruscha's gas stations.$ Eggleston, a man of few words, has called his pictures$ He took colour at face value.Bill said" If I just make the colour hierarchy the structure$ " of the picture, can that work and still do realistic subject matter, still do the real world?"$ Do you think he was literally saying that to himself?Yeah.$ That one little red stop light up there trumps this whole large volume area of green.There's one of a shower stall that would be absolutely nothing.$ It's sort of this bilious green and a dreadful pink and it's shot in flash.$ And it, it feels, because of the colour, like it's like it's a shower in Auschwitz or something.$ Eggleston's take is so particular, it's also eminently portable.Wherever he goes, his world travels with him.$ In October 2005 he was persuaded to visit the port of Dunkirk in northern France.$ In a landscape of wind blown dunes, steelworks and container ships, far removed from the American south, Eggleston sought out photographic treasure.$ So my name is Claire.$ C-L-A-R..... I-R-E.Thank you very much.$ When Eggleston returned to Dunkirk to open an exhibition devoted to his work, it was a chance for critics and journalists to see if they could turn the pure gold of his pictures into the hard currency of words and explanations.$ No.I have always worked... quite alone.$ They didn't get very far.$ I've never really thought about that.Food does exist, sort of like cars exist.$ Do you have any particular relation to Edward Hopper's...?$ Yeah.No.$ Actually it's quite difficult to talk about William Eggleston's work, and he can't tell you the answer either.Actually not a lot of people are gonna make sense talking about it.I don't know quite what you mean by that.$ Who am I to say?$ I like that picture, I don't know why.I mean that picture's a very intriguing one because that looks like in America in some diner.$ But also maybe I like it because it's done here but it looks so... not from here.$ And it does look like a painting.$ It looks totally abstract and it looks like something... when I'm in a cafe, I see something different in a cafe.$ I'll tell you, I've replied before to a similar question, and the reply...$ I've given in the pastI still will stick with.$ I'm about photographing life today.$ Photographers continue to go out into the world in order to photograph life today.$ But what they have in common is a watchful attentiveness to the world and its ways.$ They see the things we miss or don't think about and then report back so that we have a chance to think again.$ It seems to me photographers are angels not Gods.$ Their job is not to create from nothing, but to better understand what is created and to better see the world so that the world is coherent, has meaning, has consequences, significance.$ But photography has to build this out of the facts that we all know by walking dirty streets and living in dirty air.$ You're not permitted like philosophers or theologians to fly off into the abstract.$ And, and I think that's what, frankly, I think that's what has made photography into something of more than usual importance right now.$ These places... mean something and part of the job is just trying to find what the hell that is.$

Croce?- Outside.$ Croce, are you in there?$ If you think you can rappel in that outfit.$ What's she doing?$ That chick is a real banana boat.$ Pulls up in a Ferrari, leaves in a wagon?$ I hate when she does that.$ It's all right, we made a trade.$ I'll take care of it.$ Well, isn't this interesting how we run into each other twice in one day.$ Let me guess, you're an insurance investigator.$ What else?$ Danny sure could pick' em.$ I'll take that as a compliment.$ I thought you might have modem'd that.$ Yeah, but it's all scrambled.$ I know this is a multi-syllabic binary code, and that the Ganubians use it all the time.$ Fact is, I have a decoding programmer disk in my car.$ Why don't you get it, and we can unscramble this mess together.$ I believe you have my keys.$ Allow me.$ Be right back.$ Put your hands on the car.$ -

Then let's do it.- But how?$ Well, first we're gonna need some diamonds for him to steal.$ Well, I have a diamond stick pin I inherited.$ Probably worth $ 600.$ Where are we going to get diamonds that he would want to steal?$ How about the code room at the consulate?$ You wanna steal the diamonds Sumal has stolen$ - so that he can steal them back?- Right.$ From what we've been dug up, this Sumal is an extremely arrogant guy.$ - He'd be a cinch to set up.$ - It could work.$ He loves women, playing squash, and diamonds.$ Pick the order, those are his passions.$ Great, but how are those passions going to get us into a secure code room in a foreign consulate?$ Wait a minute.$ Diamonds, women, squash.$ Squash.$ He's got to carry the key with him, right?$ So if I could get into his locker at the Racquet Club...I could make a mould, to make a copy of our own key.$ Of course we're gonna need some bait.$ What kind of bait?$ A diamond.$ A very big diamond.$ I'll be happy to double this if you'd tell Mr Sumal he's at my regular table, and please ask him to move.$ Excuse me, sir, but I'm afraid you are sitting at a reserved table.$ -

About an hour.$ I must have left just after nine.$ Do you remember what sort of jacket you were wearing?$ Jacket?$ A simple, light-coloured jacket from Zara.$ Do you recognise this?$ Yes.$ This is a medal that Snorri always wore.$ Do you happen to know who owns the other half?$ No, I...$ - Could it be Larus?$ No, no.$ Larus doesn't own anything like this.$ Inga showing people evidence doesn't get us anywhere unless we are conducting a proper interrogation.$ She was really taken aback when she saw the medal... but if I was going to make sure that Snorri didn't wake up I wouldn't leave something behind that could be linked to me.$ Unless you wanted to direct suspicion towards someone else.$ Can you, please?$ - Yes.$ Oh, God.I'm sorry.$ - It's okay.$ I didn't mean to.$ - It's okay.$ I have to take him to his grandma.$ Shall we try Halldora again later?$ - Yes.$ Shall we say around 2?$ - Yes.$ I was wondering if you recognised this phone number 929-2279.$ You're wasting your time.$ We're in rural Iceland.$ A bit of jealousy and envy is normal.$ This was an accident and I don't want my son's memory to be linked to a crime or a murder case.$ Have you seen this?$ DIGGER OPERATOR MURDERED?$ No.$ - No.$ These hacks only want to create headlines that sell.$ I don't know where the paper got this from.$ They're making it up.$ You should stop it.$ It doesn't matter what you find.$ He's dead... and I just want to be left in peace to give him a beautiful funeral.$ It's not my decision.$ - You write the report.$ Inga writes the report.$ - But you can have a say in it.$ I can't stop the investigation.$ Inga's in control.$ I was wondering, would it be alright if I had a look at Snorri's room?$ You like her.$ Who?$ - This woman.$ Inga?$ No, no.$ First of all she's married and secondly I'm not attracted to her.$ Fine.$ But it suits you.$ It's my old room.$ You know your way.$ Halldora Reynisdottir?$ - Yes.$ We're from the police.$ Can we come in and talk for a minute?$ I don't believe it.$ Had you been seeing each other for long?$ Almost a year.$ But it wasn't working.$ I didn't want to live on a farm and he couldn't imagine living anywhere else.$ Did you see Snorri on the night of the accident?$ No, I was at a friend's house.$ I was home in bed by midnight.$ Alone?$ Yes.$ What's your friend's name?$ Bara...$ Where does she live?$ - Geirsdottir?$ Birkivellir 4.$ Did you visit Snorri in the hospital?$ - No, I'm afraid not.$ I couldn't cope.$ And I wasn't really welcome there.$ Why not?$ - His parents don't speak to me.$ They always thought I was stealing their only son.$ Where were you last night?$ - Yesterday?$ Yes.$ Hermann downstairs said that you went away.$ I was with my sister, in Reykjavik.$ - Can we verify that.$ Rosa.$ Raudalaekur 53.$ Didn't you hear about it on the radio?$ - No.$ You didn't see the papers?$ No.$ I'm just hearing this now.$ Excuse me.$ I'm going to get the phone.$ Did you tell us where you were this morning?$ Yes.$ At my sister's.$ I can see that you've marked the day in your calendar.$ That's not any of your business.$ I run a massage parlour.$ Now I want you to go.$ What are you doing here?$ - I'm just trying to fix the radiator.$ Didn't you do that yesterday?$ - Yes, but it's broken.$ Not my fault.$ Do you recognise the number 9292279?$ No.$ - Are you sure?$ Yes.$ That's all.$ Were you wearing this jacket last night?$ Yes, so what?$ Thanks.$ Can I have a massage?$ - No, Hermann.$ No.$ But the circle is growing bigger if anything.$ You need to get to the bottom of this soon.$ We'd get this done quicker if we had more people on the case.$ Helgi, you know that the budget does not allow it.$ Have they found the person that the mother saw?$ Not yet.$ - You must speed things up.$ I'll speak to you later.$ Bye.$ I've started printing things out and I booked two rooms for us if we wanted to stay here.$ Okay.$ Shall we go over this.$ Dora.$ Yes, she's hiding something.$ She knew who's phone number it was.$ She's also lying about being alone because Hermann heard someone.$ He saw the grey pick-up drive away at 2 am so if we assume that Snorri was in the car he must have been heading straight for the cliff.$ But why?$ And why is Dora lying?$ Maybe they were arguing and he stormed out.$ Yes, but we can pretty much rule out suicide because there was probably someone else by the cliff.$ Dora does not have a record and the bar and parlour are clean.$ I'm still wondering why she'd marked today on the calendar.$ Could she have known that they were waking Snorri?$ No.$ It could have been anything.$ Larus.$ He doesn't have any alibi and the lighter that we found by the cliff... is probably his.$ And he's a competitor.$ This medal.$ Eydis and Veigar say that Larus got this half but Anna denies that.$ I think we should look into this more.$ Find out if anything suspicious happened at the hospital.$ There was nothing suspicious.$ It was just cardiac arrest.$ Have you seen the autopsy report?$ - No, but we should wait with this.$ Yes, let's keep it open.$ Anna.$ - She and Snorri used to be a couple.$ What?$ - I found this letter here.$ " Dear Snorri.$ I don't know what to say but I want to say so much.$ My heart hurts.$ We shared so many moments."$ Then it says down here.$ " This is something we'll always have together and can't be destroyed.$ Where did you get this?$ - In Snorri's room.$ It's from when they were teenagers.$ Backstreet Boys.$ This is Robbie Williams, right here.$ - No, he was in Take That.$ So they were a couple.$ Shouldn't we go to this meeting tonight?$ No.$ Orri will be there and I know exactly what he'll be saying.$ My towering, beautiful cliff!$ Excuse me.What are you doing here?$ - What?$ Isn't anyone free to park here?$ You're aware that all work in the area is banned.$ Yes.$ I was told that they were starting again tomorrow and then I'm supposed to be blowing up the cliff.$ You will not be doing anything until they've lifted the ban.$ Is that clear?$ - Yes.$ Una!$ - What?$ I'll go speak to him.$ You are Una, aren't you?$ Yes.$ I'm in your books.$ I climbed up the mast down there.$ I see.$ Do you think this place will be flooded?$ - That's what they want.$ This has to be stopped.$ They cannot commit more environmental murders.$ Fucking industry.$ Do you know Snorri?$ He has sometimes given me a lift home from dances.$ If he's not with Dora.$ He always drives.$ He doesn't drink.$ - What about last night.$ I got a lift with Ulfur.$ On the bike.$ Let's go.$ Aslaug.$ Hello!$ Even though I'm old, and the house too, it's not a museum for tourists.$ My name is Inga Aradottir and...- Yes.$ I know who you are.$ But what you are doing here.$ - I came to see you.$ No one came to the door and it was open so I thought something had happened.$ - You hardly thought I was lying dead in a locked room?$ No.$ Well.$ I'm going to make some coffee.$ Come on.$ Ulfur had been coming here so often to help me out that I offered him that room.$ He doesn't get along with his brother.$ Is everyone happy about him seeing that girl?$ Aren't you worried that she might get pregnant?$ From my experience nothing is more remarkable than when two people truly love each other.$ That's rare and I don't intend to spoil it.$ Weren't Anna and Snorri a couple once?$ Who says that?$ - They were, weren't they?$ Snorri was a good boy.$ He couldn't help the way his father is.$ Ladies and gentlemen.Although we are all devastated by this accident we must not let grief make us lose sight of our common goal of giving this region a better future.$ I know I speak for many when I say that it's important that this job is on schedule.$ Otherwise plans to strengthen energy distribution all around the country could be jeopardised.$ Where does this region then stand, with regards to employment?$ Thank you.$ Where is your stuff?$ I don't think we should go.$ How am I supposed to catch the bus?$ I just think it is a bit lame to be leaving now.$ You never have the courage to do anything anyway.$ Even if people deny it in public, everyone knows this line is the beginning of their next project to build a hydro-electric plant in this region.$ This line will destroy the cliff, the dam will flood the waterfalls.$ This will put an end to all tourism in the area.$ That's right!$ - Thank you.$ I've told you where the explosives are and you can read all about how to do this on the Internet.$ I'm not that into you.$ Do you think I enjoy having sex with you in that stupid room at this old woman's house?$ Cut it out, Una.$ Una.Come on.Una!$ Una...$ Una!$ Una...$ Una!$ I know the cliff well enough to know that there will be no rest unless we make peace with those who live there.$ I suggest that we put all work in the area on hold and set up a meeting with a medium... or someone who can contact someone on the other side.$ Let's vote on this proposal.$ Those who agree raise their hand.$ Hi, what's up?$ We're at home going over things after the meeting.$ Will you be long?$ - No, but we'll go on for a bit.$ Are you staying up there tonight?$ - I don't know.$ Is Olof there?$ - Yes.$ Is she there!$ - Of course.So what.$ Just wondering.$ You know me better than that!$ Yes.I'll speak to you later.$ - Bye.$ And what does this mean?$ Well, it means that Snorri went into cardiac arrest about an hour after his last dose of medication.$ According to the day plan and the medication record there was nothing unusual about this dose.$ I see.$ - Are you coming back tonight?$ No, I'm staying.$ - When are you coming?$ I don't know.$ - You can tell me if you just want to forget about this.$ Marin.$ I'm working.- Okay.We'll be in touch.$ Okay.$ Damn, you're lame.$ Hi.$ - I thought you'd gone home.$ No, I thought you were going back to Reykjavik.$ Did you go to the meeting?$ - Orri did well.$ I met Lauga.$ - How was that?$ Good.$ I saw a really cute picture of you and Eydis.$ Really?$ - First love?$ They decided to get a medium to make a deal with the hidden people about finishing this.$ Have you tried the hotel bar?$ - No.$ Shall we?$ Yes.$ Didn't you go abroad to study after you finished the academy?$ Yes.$ FBI?$ - No.$ But I did a one-week... fingerprint course there once.$ - Okay.$ I studied in Sweden.$ Malmo.$ Malmo.$ - It was good.$ That's great.$ Really great.$ This is a nice place.$ And when will we be paid for the land.$ - Next year.$ It's always paid afterwards.$ - That's if we haven't lost the land.$ When did you last make a payment on the loan?$ They're threatening us with repossession.Veigar.$ You have to make a deal with Larus about the digger...$ I've already done it He's starting tomorrow.$ We don't get the first payment until we have finished.$ I'll end up having to hand over the job.$ Damn Lauga has cursed us.$ Since when do you believe in that sort of thing?$ What the hell are you supposed to believe?$ Our most valuable horse dies.$ My hand keeps getting worse.$ Then the boy kills himself.$ - Don't say that.$ It isn't true.$ So what the hell was he doing there in the middle of the night?$ And that damned slut from the bar, with the massage parlour.$ And it doesn't help how you've been acting.$ Always listening to his whining.$ You let him feel sorry for himself until he gave up.$ So, have you and Marin been together for long?$ We are not together.$ No, why did you think that?$ I don't know.$ I just...$ - Was someone talking about it?$ No, we're just friends.$ Will you not have to move to Reykjavik when Orri becomes an MP?$ Have you applied for a job?- Yes.$ But I haven't heard anything.$ Thanks again for today.$ - No problem.How's he doing?$ Fine.$ - Cute boy.$ Yes.$ He's adorable.$ I don't understand how you can do this.$ What?$ I don't know what I would do if I lost Valur.$ Life goes on.$ That's they way it is.$ What?$ Are you sleeping outside?$ It's cold.$ Come on.$ Come inside.What's wrong with you?$ What's wrong with you?$ Come inside.$ Did you see this, Ulfur?$ What?$ No, I just heard a noise.$ Is everything alright?$ Mum?$ Is dad going to work at the cliff tomorrow?$ Yes... now he finally gets a chance to use his fancy digger.$ But it's dangerous.$ - No, it isn't.$ Daddy is always careful.$ Remember, he went to the school.$ The car will be completely crushed.$ No, sweetheart.$ You just had a bad dream$ No.$ - Yes.$ Come on.$ It's all going to be fine.$ Let's try to get some sleep.$ Let's try to get some sleep.$ Have you seen my boots?$ -

Yes.$ Great.$ Inga.$ Yes.$ We'll be there.$ Bye.$ Have you seen daddy's boots?$ Where are they?$ Under my bed.$ Helga.$ It will be fine as long as he isn't wearing the boots.$ LEAVE ME ALONE!$ Protect the cliff!$ ...

What difference does that make?$ None whatsoever.$ But it must have created tension.$ With Snorri and Lárus.$ - She is Veigar's daughter.$ Who?$ - Anna.$ She is Snorri's halfsister.$ They didn't know about it.$ But when they started going out together$ Veigar had to tell them and then they had to split up.$ It was very tragic.$ They were very much in love.$ You know, like young people will.$ Just come.$ You stand there, I'll stand here.$ Sleeping?$ Where did you go after the dance?$ I told you.$ I was falling asleep at the wheel.$ So I decided to sleep and slept until morning.$ Where did you get gas?$ You said we were out of gas.$ There was a can in the trunk.$ Do you think I'll believe this?$ There wasn't a can in the trunk.$ We talked about this.$ We can do this.$ We're getting there.$ We're good together.$ Hello.$ - Hello.$ Let's pick Lárus up tomorrow.$ - Yes...$ We have got enough.$ The football T-shirt.$ They lived in that part of the city.$ We have his footprint on the pickup.$ The unregistered number was bought by someone at Teigur.$ When we pick Lárus up we can compare the fingerprints with the one on the lighter.$ You know he was there.$ He knew Snorri and Veigar were losing the contract.$ If that happened he would get it.$ So to guarantee it he wanted to damage the excavator.$ Helgi.$ Hello.$ Yes, sorry.$ If you got any comments this would be a good time.$ It's just somehow too simple.$ - This case too simple?$ I think this is all very obvious.$ Then Snorri surprised him by coming up there.$ He and Lárus fought and somehow the excavator with Snorri in it went over the cliff.$ We can't just decide it is.$ - I know you care about them.$ Is that bad?$ So you say the hidden people caused the accident and killed Snorri in the hospital?$ Not at all but the hidden people warn us.$ The land is a living being and it defends itself when we attack it as we have always done.$ The hidden people know it but can't stop it.$ Jón, the little boy at Teigur sees all kinds of things.$ He says he saw a man in a long grey coat with bandages on his head push a boulder off the cliff.$ That must have been my grandfather's brother, Ásegir.$ Who's Ásgeir?$ - Follow me.$ This is Ásgeir He lived here.$ He had an accident.$ He slipped on ice when he was looking for sheep.$ The next morning he woke up under the cliff.$ He never knew how he got there.$ A cloth like this had never been seen here until Ásgeir came with it bandaged around his head and covered in blood.$ It's been in the family since.$ Ásgeir forbade us to cut the grass near the cliff and said the cliff should never be touched.$ Those who are sensitive see many things.$ Well, Helgi.$ You are probably needed elswhere.$ And you should listen to Anna's little boy.$ Away with you.$ - I'm going.$ Excuse me.$ Can I talk to you?$ Stop.$ What happened?$ There was a man here and when I wanted to talk to him he ran away and I couldn't catch him.$ He had a backpack full of something,I saw where he was coming from and someone had broken in.$ See.$ I don't know what has been stolen but it looks like something was here in this box.$ Strange that this wheel is covered.$ - Yes.$ Let me take a look.$ - What?$ Don't touch this.$ We have to go in and clean this up.$ All right?$ - Yes.$ Let me see.$ Am I hurting you?$ " Investigation going nowhere."$ Hello.$ It's obvious that explosives have been kept in the box.$ Dynamite must have fallen out of the backpack when Inga fought the man.$ We should have found this the other day.$ The same type as was stolen from Veigar up at the cliff.$ The people who live here and some of the workers have access to this storage room.$ Nobody here is going to break in.$ We are looking for someone who knew about the explosives.$ But doesn't have a key.$ We're good together.$ How are you?$ -

Ólafur.$ I'm going to talk to Hildur and Gunnar.$ I'll be right out.$ - Great.$ Let's talk this over at a better time.$ A 23 year old man died there.$ That's tragic of course but I don't know anything about it.$ We suspect that you stole 25 kilos of explosives and caps from Veigar and Snorri Inc., near Fell cliff, explosives which were stolen from your shed last night.$ As a suspect you have a right to be silent.$ Do you understand?$ - Yes.$ Can you describe what happened that night?$ This powerline and the electricity plant isn't just destroying the beautiful nature here.$ We just want to know what happened that night.$ I decided to take the explosives to delay the construction.$ I bicycled up there and put the explosives in my bag.$ Then I went away.$ Did you see something or hear there?$ - No.$ A witness driving up there that night said he saw someone on a bicycle on the road.$ Did you meet a car?$ Yes, I met Eydís at Bakki.$ I'm sure she didn't recognize me.$ We know when she was there.$ She called the emergency number from Snorri's phone soon after she met you.$ - Yes.$ Then the excavator had just fallen off the cliff.$ Snorri's car was there with the lights and radio on.$ Are you saying that you saw nobody, didn't hear any noise from a car, didn't see any lights and saw no movements?$ What is this?$ I confessed that I stole the explosives.$ What more do you want?$ You realize that now you are the only one we know of who was there apart from Snorri.$ I didn't see anything.$ I didn't hear anything.$ Lárus, you have to come with us to the station.$ -

What's going on?$ Anna, you have to come with us well.$ As a witness.$ What nonsense is this?$ Do you have to do this here in front of the children?$ You can go and talk with them or call someone who can keep them company.$ Freyr will wait for you.$ Ólafur$ You can't tell us anything about the night of the accident other than that you slept in the car?$ Is that forbidden?$ Anna said that you told her that the car was out of gas.$ That's why she got someone to drive her home from the dance.$ How did you manage to drive home?$ I had a can in the trunk.$ - Which Anna didn't know about.$ No.$ - What happened to the can after that?$ I threw it away.- Why didn't you go all the way home?$ You were only two kilometers away.$ Because I was tired.$ Do you know the phonenumber 929-2279?$ Yes, it's the number of a mobile phone I gave to Lárus.$ Do you know where the phone is?$ - He lost it.$ When?$ - I don't know.$ If I knew then it wouldn't maybe be lost.$ When did you find out the phone was lost?$ Last weekend, I think.$ He told me then.$ How long do I have to be here?$ I've told you all this before.$ Why didn't you film that?$ We know you took gas that morning at Vellir.$ You weren't up there.$ Do you recognize this?$ It is marked JL.$ - Probably Jón's.$ What has this got to do with it?$ Did you find any socks?$ Can you explain why it was in the gas tank of Snorri's excavator?$ This is ridiculous.$ The unregistered number...$ She gave him the phone.$ But he said he lost it around the time of the accident.$ He would hardly call himself.$ - No.$ So Snorri called.$ - It must be.$ It's such a short time.$ It must be.$ I visited Snorri twice at the hospital.$ I cared a great deal about him.$ That's understandable.$ What do you mean?$ You were once very much in love.$ Yes, we were.$ Then you found out he was your halfbrother.$ Yes.$ Do you know of anyone who would have wanted to stop Snorri from waking up?$ You have to tell us.$ - No.$ No idea.$ What?$ Aren't you going to turn it on?$ I was just thinking what kind of person it is who can spin such a web of lies and how far he would be ready to go to uphold the lie.$ I'm going to show you a picture of a footprint which we found, just newly made on Snorri's car.$ This is your footprint.$ Containing compressor-oil from the excavator.$ They are the same.$ We also have a lighter which was found where the excavator went off the cliff.$ Your fingerprints are on it.$ When did you lose your mobile phone?$ - When?$ You have the phonenumber 929-2279, right?$ - Yes.$ Your mobile phone was called from Snorri's car phone a few minutes before his mother found him and called for help.$ Do you know what I think?$ I think you were going to get the excavator off the cliff while everybody was at the dance.$ Snorri saw your car up there, tried to call you and then he saw the excavator moving.$ He came up there, you managed to jump out but he tried to stop the excavator.$ You knew he would tell us when he woke up so you wanted to stop that from happening.$ Are you out of your mind?$ I haven't talked to Snorri for months.$ I wasn't near the cliff.$ The phone was on silent.$ Snorri was my friend.$ - Why don't you just confess?$ I was with Dóra.$ The phone was on silent.$ I never did anything to Snorri.$ Never.$ That's the truth.$ What happened to the phone?$ I forgot it at Dóra's.$ When did you arrive at her place?$ - At midnight.$ Had this been going on for a long time?$ No, we slept together once before.$ It was a moment of madness.$ Not supposed to happen again.$ But then... you know.$ Did you know she and Snorri had been together?$ - Yes.$ And?$ I heard him on the voice mail.$ Then he came and knocked.$ She didn't open.$ It was horrible.$ It was obvious he was very much in love with her.$ Then he left.$ Drove away.$ In a grey pickup?$ - Yes.$ When?$ - Between one and two.$ We will talk to Dóra.Will she confirm this?$ Definitely.$ I haven't talked to her after this.$ Inga, you've got a phonecall.$ I knocked and knocked but she didn't answer.$ I heard loud music.$ She didn't answer so I decided to look in.$ I didn't know what do to so I called you.$

4550863$ welcome to Basalt Mountain located on the northern rim of the Roaring Fork valley in Colorado.$ The climate here is hot and dry in the summer and frigid in the winter.$ To the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here.$ until now no one would have considered farming in this dry rocky nutrient poor soil.$ But thanks to our current understanding of nature's natural processes one man has built up a nutrient rich soil upon this dry undesirable clay forming the foundation for a thriving ecosystem$ Jerome Osentowski is the man behind the ecosystem and the Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute.$ nestled on the side of Basalt Mountain lye one acre of edible forest garden guilds and four passive and active solar greenhouses which have become a large part of Jerome's most recent Permaculture endeavors$ I came to Colorado in 1969 andI spent about the first seven or eight, ten years$ As a ski instructor.$ and gradually got interested in healthy foods$ Through having somewhat of a health crisis with hyperglycemia so I decided to look into wild foods and that lead me into growing my own gardens and using wild foods when it was available$ Jerome began gardening in the lowlands of the Basalt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on Basalt Mountain due to the arid soils and difficulty in harnessing water but once I learned about permaculture$ I found that it was totally possible to create these beautiful gardens using recycled materials, and building compost, sheet mulching, using perennial and annual vegetablesIn combinations of designs$ So, we started annual gardening here for ten years or so and then we gradually segued into perennial polycultures outside and now inside and we've taught hundreds of people here through internship programs and through the different design courses and workshops here.$ what's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combination of plants in our forest gardens and see how we build our greenhouse$ But Jerome's success in Permaculture hasn't come without some major road blocks$ In 2008 a devastating fire burned down one of his first tropical greenhouse'sIronically named Pele [ after the Hawaiian fire goddess ] to the ground.$ the fire in Pele was actually a blessing in disguise.because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger, better greenhouse.$ So I worked with Michael Thomson my partner in Ecosystems Design to redesign the new greenhouse.$ At the time that Pele burned down Jerome had been working with well know local architect Michael Thompson on advancing greenhouse design by introducing what Jerome called" Climate Battery Technology"$ The destruction of Pele gave the two the chance to put their latest research to the test and in the spirit on new beginnings the new greenhouse would be named Phoenix after the mythological bird that burns itself and rises from the ashes to live through another cycle.$ Hi I'm Michael Thompson,$ I'm chief architect with ecosystems design in Basalt Colorado and partner with Jerome Osentowski.$ The climate battery as we now call it, is a series of tubing in which air is taken in at the high point of the greenhouse, pumped through tubing, and exhausted at the south end of the greenhouse.$ and then that air circulates over and over again picking up heat and then delivering it underground and storing it.$ So at ecosystems design, we create designs for greenhouses and passive solar buildings and homes as well as outdoor landscaping perennials and annuals for organic agriculture in the rocky mountain region.$ in addition to designing indoor and outdoor Permaculture and edible landscapes$ We create the buildings that allow that indoor growing, such as this one in Steamboat Springs.$ This is a large thirty six by eighty foot greenhouse that will support sub-tropical and anything below that.$ and here we have inside the greenhouse, all of these planting beds that we have created above ground and under ground we have these forced air heat storage systems$ So all of these fans are delivering air through these vertical risers which then underground distribute the warm air through these horizontal manifolds through these perforated tubes that deliver the heat and the moisture from that air into the soil for use later in the cold nights.$ So as a result we get these indoor environments that are very well insulated and heated against winter conditions such as this last year.$ and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experiencing is uhh...$ This is when we began the planting of this greenhouse last autumn, and this spring we had this much growth in there.$ So we have flowers, we have other plants that support the insect populations for beneficial controls and for pollination, and we have all of the soil conditions and the climate conditions to grow tropical Banana plants, and Guavas and Figs and Papaya etcetera.$ and these greenhouses also function very well as early propagation centers$ Where we can start the plants in February that will grow outdoors as annuals.$ We also have climate control equipment like these curtains that draw across underneath the glazing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insulating layer for accomplishing that.$ So we also do solar homes solar energy productive buildings.$ in addition to designing greenhouses for private investors CRMPI and growing spaces are building growing domes for local schools in colorado in order to raise awareness about the importance of a local food economy.$ the institute has currently built a growing dome at Yampa Mountain High School in Glenwood$ Springs and the Roaring Fork High School in Carbondale both facilities will be utilized as classrooms for sustainable agriculture curriculums and the food produced will be integrated into the school lunches. there you can find out more about our services and browse our design galleries.$ for more information about the Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute and how you can contribute please visit CRMPI.ORG there you'll find detailed information about our growing dome projects via the community food initiative as well as workshop dates and internship availability.$ and built the Geodesic Growing Domes used at the local high schools and special thanks to John Cruickshank for his role in the technological advancements of what is now called the Climate Battery$ Thanks For Watching$ 
4540318$ 3rd day of fair in Libramont( Belgium) where all forms of agriculture are exposed.$ From the most industrialized ones to the most natural.$ Here is a particular type of agriculture, somehow taboo, the permaculture.$ The principle:let the nature do, by avoiding plowing for example...$ A report by Aurelie Didier.$ Translated from french to english by The Unknown Masturbator.$ Look at that!$ Hmmm...This is good!$ More than 2000 types of fruit trees, a delight from my garden,$ Here are yellow raspberries$ 5000 kinds of vegetables, it's a 1800 sq meters labyrinth you have to taste that, it's a Japanese rose!$ A food forest in the center of Mouscron( Belgium)$ - It's small,... - but the taste is uncomparable...$ - and it's beautiful!$ Amazingly, the soil has never been plowed...$ We never plow the garden.$ The soil has never been turned over nor moved since about 40 years.$ The organic wastes are thrown directly on the floor$ We kept as much as possible compost that the soil will get back, digest it to its own profit and to the one of the growing plants.$ This couple have, by this way, recreated some kind of" jungle"...$ It's the opposite of all paradigms in agronomy.$ There was never any pesticide, insecticide... used in this garden since 40 years.$ Normally, nothing should grow here$ This is the life's triumph.$ The usual gardening is death.$ It's the war, the fight.$ We have to kill everything that's moving:$ Weeds, insects...$ Here it's the opposite, I aim to feed everyone, and everyone is participating.$ There's so much birds other, that I never see a caterpillar, and only a few slugs, we have less and less work, and more and more food.$ To give an independent opinion, we have asked to a specialist of horticulture to come.$ The soil's quality is incredible.$ All a life system has been recreated underground.$ It's ventilated and rich$ To dig with a spade would destroy it.$ But according to the specialist, the permaculture is difficult to apply into the intensive agriculture, in which the fruits have to be aligned and harvested with machines.$ Permaculture would be more adapted to market gardening, and would be beneficial to market gardeners who sell locally directly fresh products.$ We can think about it, with a manual products harvest.$ At home, they have more than 6000 types of seeds, 800 kinds of tomatoes for example.$ - I would like some lamb's lettuce seeds$ - number 102-010$ This couple want the organic farming to be affordable.$ They teach and give curses.$ Here, one pack of seeds is only 25 cts.$ We have been always really annoyed that the organic products are affordable one by rich people.$ People become back creators, they cultivate the plant from the begin to the end, they consume it, they keep the seed to reproduce it.$ They are participating to the creation.But now, we only ask them to do this way, we only ask them to obey and to not think about what they do.$ And the people become stupid idiot.$ Here, the food is never put in tin-can.$ They are varieties that grow all year long.$ People usually think that salads are growing only part of the year.$ That's false!Even in winter we can eat lettuces and many different vegetables.$ After 40 years of gardening, this couple discover each year, new varieties of plants that appear in their garden.$

difficult to really trust yourself.$ You don't want to do something, then you do it.$ The only thing I have confidence in, in my life, 100%, is music.$ Even if you don't give your life to music, music will take you over.$ So, I just let myself go and wherever music takes me, so be it.$ I have no worries concerning that.$ I'm not sad.$ I mean, I have peace.$ Sometimes I look annoyed, it's things

special book.$ Eh, what kind of book?$ Well, this book tells you how to find Paradise... through Christ.$ They've heard of the Bible.$ We all have.$ Banbanchelfi.$ Hey girl.$ People come and tell us about Jesus and him dying for our sins once a year.$ They always come, tell us the story, and leave!$ Nothing is better!$ Your Bible doesn't work.$ Well of course that didn't work.$ Those were Christian missionaries.$ We're Mormons.$ What's the difference?$ We've got a little more...pizzazz.$ A touch more rock' n' roll.$ And most important, a hip new prophet by the name of Joseph Smith.$ Have you heard of the All-American Prophet?$ The blond-haired, blue-eyed voice of God?$ He didn't come from the Middle East like those other holy men,$ The most blessed Prophet was All-American!$ I'm gonna take you back to Biblical times. 1823.$ An American man named Joe livin' on a farm$ In the holy land of upstate New York!$ You mean the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?$ That's right!$ That young man spoke to God!$ He spoke to God?$ And God said" Joe, people really need to know that the Bible isn't two parts!$ There's a part three to The Bible, Joe!$ And I, God, have anointed you to dig up this part three that's buried by a tree on a hill in your backyard!"$ Wow!$ God says go to your backyard and start digging!$ That makes perfect sense!$ Joseph Smith went up on that hill and dug where he was told!$ And deep in the ground Joseph found shining plates of gold!$ What are these golden plates?$ Who buried them here and why?$ Then appeared an angel:$ His name was Moroni!$ I... am Moroni.$ The All-American angel!$ My people lived here long, long ago!$ This is a history of my race, please read the words within$ We were Jews who met with Christ, but we were All-American!$ But don't let anybody see these plates except for you...They are only for you to see...$ Even if people ask you to show the plates to them, don't$ Just copy them onto normal paper$ Even though this might make them question if the plates are real or not...$ This is sort of what God is going for...$ Joseph took the plates home and wrote down what he found inside$ He turned those plates into a book, Then he rushed into town and cried:$ Hey!$ God spoke to me and gave me this blessed ancient tome$ He has commanded me to publish it And stick it in ev'ry home!$ Wow!$ So the Bible is actually a trilogy and the Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?$ !$ I'm interested!$ Now many people didn't believe the prophet Joseph Smith.$ They thought he made up this part three that was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard.$ Many people even called Joseph Smith a liar.$ So Joe said,$ This is no lie, I speak to God all the time and he told me to head west!$ So I'll take my part three from the hill with the treeFeel free if you'd like to come along with me to the promised land!$ Paradise, on the west coast!$ Nothing but fruit and fields as far as the eye can see!$ Joe led his followers across the USA$ Spreading their new religion to folks along the way$ They kept searching for that promised land, no promise there would be.$ And as they passed through every town, the Mormons would decree!$ Have you heard of the All-American prophet?$ He found a brand-new book about Jesus Christ!$ We're following him to Paradise, we call ourselves Mormon$ And our new religion is All-American!$ Wow, this all sounds so incredibly awesome!$ The Mormons kept on searching for that place to settle down$ But every time they thought they found it they got kicked out of town$ And even though people wanted to see the golden plates$ Joseph never showed' em!$ I have maggots in my scrotum$ Um... okay...$ Well, anyway...$ Now comes the part of our story That gets a little bit sad$ On the way to the promised land, Mormons made people mad$ Joseph was shot by an angry mob And knew he'd soon be dead$ And even as his life drained away, he stood by what he said:$ You must now lead the people, my good friend Brigham Young$ You're wise and pure of heart, and... all-Ameri... can$ Oh God, Why are you letting me dieWithout having me show people the plates?$ They'll have no proof I was telling the truth or not$ They'll have to believe me just...' cause$ Oh...I guess that's kinda what you were going for...$ The prophet Joseph Smith died for what he believed in.$ But his followers, they kept heading west.$ And Brigham Young led them to paradise.$ A sparkling land in Utah they called Salt Lake City.$ And we come from there today to tell you what those early settlers sang long ago!$ Have you heard of the All-American Church$ Here's a pocket hand-held Bible for you!$ It'll all make sense if you read Part 3, so follow those books from the hill with the tree!$ And you'll reach the promised land too!$ Keep you word and then we'll also throw in a set of steak knives!$ All-American!$ So?$ Who would like their very own copy of the Book of Mormon?$ What the fuck is a steak knife?$ What the heck were you doing?$ !$ Just doing my part, you know,'cause we're supposed to be a team.$ Well... there's nothing in the Book of Mormon about steak knives!$ I'm sorry.$ I've never actually read it.$ You what?$ It's... it's just so boring!$ How could I even believe that you...?$ JUMAMOSI!$ He's here!$ What is this?$ !Some kind of public assembly?$ !$ My name is General Koni, leader of the NRA Rebellion and protector!$ Here you don't protect anyone!$ We have not signed up for your rebellion!$ It is just a gang of thugs who steal and mutilate women for no reason!$ For no reason?$ !$ The clitoris... is an abomination!$ Its voodoo power has brought a wrath upon Uganda and it must be cast out!$ My wife's body is none of your business!$ And you are no general.$ By the end of the week, all females in this village will be circumcised!$ Or else...$ All right, they're all gone.$ You have to stay indoors, Nabulungi!$ Keep the lights off, and the windows closed!$ But Baba, we have to help and fight him!$ We can't fight against this, Nabulungi!$ We just have to hope they move on!$ - But Baba... they white boys...$ - What?$ They said they know the answers to our problems.$ I have to go check on the others!$ Listen to me, Baba!$ The Mormons talked about people who were miserable like us, but they all found someplace to go.$ Somewhere wonderful.$ I'm going to text them right now and tell them we are interested.$ Put that stupid thing down!$ Just stay inside, and do not open the door for anyone!$ My mother once told me of a place With waterfalls and unicorns flying$ Where there was no suffering, no pain$ Where there was laughter instead of dying$ I always thought she'd made it up To comfort me in times of pain$ But now I know that place is real Now I know its name$ Sal Tlay Ka Siti

don't go to her.$ Oh, my God, look at her arm.$ Look at her arm.$ What happened to you?$ You're okay.$ Carolina, what happened?$ Carolina shows up, and she's battered and disoriented.$ She couldn't even speak.$ She's trembling.$ I don't...$ She doesn't remember.$ You don't remember?$ What do you remember?$ She didn't know what was going on.$ She was saying she couldn't even, like, remember what she'd been doing out there.$ She was just talking nonsense, and it was really jolting to see her come back like that._You were with John?$ -

her and Johnny were fighting.$ And then, now she looks like this, so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him.$ Let's just keep moving.$ Move.$ Move.$ The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that, you know- -$ We stop and we look, and there's nothing there.$ It's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you're being watched, you know.$ Whether, you know, whether you're in the woods or in the cabin, you always feel like something is watching you, and the past two nights,I haven't slept very well, you know.$ So I'm just- -

I'm sure of what I saw.- I guess you're right.$ But you don't think I grabbed her too hard earlier, do you?$ I don't want to upset her.$ You told me that you weren't going to believe anything and just going to ignore me.But I'm really grateful for the help you gave me.$ There's no need for you to thank me.$ All I did was get my own revenge.$ It wasn't just his own wife... but that man betrayed my Kingdom as well.$ He went against his contract and signed a contract with Giant as well.$ The bastard.$ All I did was get my revenge on him for his betrayal.$ Was that why you watched over him at the hospital?Because of your own suspicions?$ All I did was see something I shouldn't have because I went down the wrong path.$ What is this?$ I'm back at the hospital.$ Let's just go home now, okay?$ I went and retrieved it because I went down the wrong path and saw what he did.$ Sometimes people find the most unexpected things along their path.There are times when they find themselves in an unexpected place during their travels.$ They think of it as unexpected luck, or even perhaps a sign of misfortune.$ But they're not... all just coincidences.$ You're telling me that it wasn't a coincidence that I got lost?$ It was a right turn.$ - Right turn.$ - What is this?Another right turn?$ Then that place earlier wasn't it?$ Stop right there.$ Don't tell me any more useless things.$ President Joo.$ I've been giving it some thought.$ And I think I've figured out a way to make myself very special to you.$ You say you're going to make yourself special to me?$ Why?$ Are you going to tell me the winning lottery numbers?$ Cha Hee Joo.She's a very special person to you, isn't she?$ I... can see Cha Hee Joo.$ That's right.$ You told me that Hee Joo is around me?$ So, if you continue to stay around me...then I guess you may get to see her again?$ Yes.$ If I can see Cha Hee Joo again... then I'll become special to you, right?$ If I see her again...I'll make sure to tell her.$ Thank you.$ See...$ Hee Joo again?$ Is there... anything that you realized after this incident?$ What about me?$ Even if the first thing you noticed about me was my money... it doesn't really matter to me.$ Honey.All you need to do is make sure that you always keep your eyes on me.$ Even though beauty fades over time, and perky breasts will come to sag... but my money will never dry up.$ So... just remain loyal and faithful as you were to me in the beginning and don't look at anyone else.$ That's enough to satisfy me.$ I'll never... change the love I have for you.$ I see only you.$ Okay.$ If I see that you're turning away from me even in the least...I won't show you any mercy.I will just get rid of you.$ That will never happen.$ Never.$ Hello.$ Here, why don't you drink this?$ Our security team is going out to dinner tonight.Why don't you come join us?$ Dinner out?$ Where you toast your drinks, and go sing at the karaoke bars?$ Yes, of course.$ I do want to go, but I...$ If it's the security team, will Team Leader Kang Woo be there as well?$ Yes.$ Gong Shil, let's go.Let's go and receive some of that energy.$ Gong Ri, you know I can't drink.There's going to trouble if I lose grip on my mentality.$ You can skip the drinking, and just have snacks.$ Sure.Then you're coming, okay?I don't mean anything else by it, but I just want us to be friends.$ I'm serious.Come on, let's go.$ Let's go.$ Cheers!$ The atmosphere seems so much livelier with you here.$ What do you think of me, Gong Shil?What do you think of my style?$ Are you trying to flirt with her?$ Settings like this depends heavily on the compatibility between the men and women here.$ How about I take this opportunity to make you a frequent fliers card?$ If you come to three outings, you get a free meal.$ If you come five times, you get a free night of drinking on us.$ And if you come ten times... blind date?$ How about a blind date?$ Since Ms.Tae Gong Shil can't drink, how about a soda for you instead?$ Here, why don't you have a soda?$ Non-alcoholic.- Everyone grab a drink, and cheers!- Cheers!$ Hey, Gong Shil.You look tired.Why don't you go relax over there?$ Come on, get up.$ Can you scoot over a little?$ Here, lean back and relax.$ I wonder if I'm just tired.$ Why does my head hurt so badly?$ Are you okay?$ Yes.$ I'm having a great time.$ It's been a really long time since I've been out with other people like this.$ Are you not feeling well?$ - Could it be that you're drunk?$ - I didn't have anything to drink.$ I'm too scared to drink.Because I become a whole different person when I get drunk.$ Most other people gets that way when they're drunk.$ But I really do... become a whole different person.$ Cha Hee Joo.$ What you said about you liking me because I come from a rich family... did you mean it?$ Are you... hesitating right now?$ That's pretty offensive.I just pretended to think about it so that you don't feel offended.$ If I admit it right away... then it would only hurt you.$ Joo Joong Won, are you angry?$ I know that you'll stop being mad at me if I call out your name three times.$ Joo Joong One.$ Joo Joong Two.$ Joo Joong Three.$ It's not the least bit funny.$ Even though you may not find it funny, you're no longer mad at me, right?$ Bitch.$ It's that woman.$ I told him that I'd get him to meet her again.$ That woman I reported to you about the last time does seem to have a special relationship with President Joo.$ I will continue to watch her and see if she has anything to do with Cha Hee Joo.And what else she may know.$ Tae Gong Shil?$ Why are you here?$ How did you find out where I live?$ You hitched a ride in my car, and came into my Kingdom and now you dare to ring the doorbell to my house?$ Didn't I warn you?Did I not tell you to stop?$ Joong Won.$ Joong Won?$ You've completely lost your mind.$ -

Why don't we go upstairs?$ Is that young lady your employee?$ - She keeps looking over here.$ - Stop looking at her and let's just go.$ Because this whole thing is killing me.$ Go on ahead without me.$ Have you been well this past week?$ You don't look like you've been too bad.$ I myself felt like I was going to die.$ President Joo, are you really getting married?$ Aren't you even curious?$ Aren't you curious to know what this woman thinks of you?$ Secret, my butt.$ - I can see it written all over your face.$ - Do you see something?$ Something that's as scary to me as the ghosts that you see.$ President Joo.$ Are you getting married because you want to avoid being around me?$ Tae Gong Shil.$ Do you think that you're important enough to have an effect on my decision to marry?$ No.$ Then that would mean that you don't have the right to ask me why nor do I have any responsibility to you to answer that question, would it?$ Yes.$ Episode 10.$ Your aunt already went up.$ Let's go.$ I know I've already told you this, but I really hate being touched.$ Even if you think that you might fall flat on your face try not to touch me unless you absolutely have to.$ Our Master Joo is such a jerk even to the woman that he's going to marry.$ Why is he marrying her if he doesn't even want her to touch him?$ He should've told me about it sooner.$ He's such a jerk.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ Kang Woo.$ Did you not know that President Joo is to be married?$ No, I didn't.$ It's just such sudden news, and I feel a little flustered by it.$ Didn't President Joo turn around and come back from his business trip on the day of Ruijjang's concert?$ Did something happen that night when you two saw each other?$ He came back here that night?$ Then... that man that I saw that night was President Joo?$ So, he did... come back to see you.$ I was so out of it that day, and I wasn't really being myself.$ I must've met with President Joo when Ruijjang's wife took over my body.$ I wonder what those two talked about?$ Secret, my butt.$ I can see it written all over your face.$ She must've told him my secret.$ Your secret?$ I think she must've told President Joo about me liking him.$ What should I do?$ Even though I need you need the partnership, is it okay to be getting married like this?$ Yes, it is.$ Because I calculated that up here, and I got the answer for it.$ It's just that Ms. Tae looked really shocked and flustered by the news.$ What are you going to do?$ The reason why I can't get an answer on that woman no matter how I calculate it... is because she wasn't up here... but it was because I held her somewhere else.$ Even though it shocked me to my core, I accepted what I needed to accept.$ Then you should let her know about it, too.$ And you should also let her know that you're not really going to be getting married.$ I don't want to.$ Chief Secretary Kim.$ The fact that I'm still not reading... or the reason why I still can't read... is not because of this up here, but it's because of a problem down here.$ I want to live my life churning the wheel up here, which works just fine for me.$ Since Ms. Tae is someone who can see spirits... wouldn't she be able to see your problems clearly and comfort you?$ In that case, when I die, I'll return as a ghost... and I'll go see her then.$ I think he's trying to get rid of me.$ I can't be without President Joo.$ Does he have to be the only one whom you can run to when you want to hide?$ He's the only one in the world whom I can rely on to do that.$ I barely got him to allow me near him after clinging onto him all this time.$ Marrying another woman and having her remain by his side probably means that he doesn't want you to remain by his side.$ Now that he's planning on getting married...I'm sure that he'll just tell me to get lost if he knows that I like him.$ I thought you said that you liked him.$ When he ignores you like that... don't you find it painful?$ In your world...$ I'm probably just another candy girl and President Joo, the knight in shining armor?$ But in my world, I'm just a radar that can see ghosts and President Joo is the safety shelter where I can run and hide.$ I can't be a candy girl.$ Because that man... has no intentions of being the prince.$ But since I can still be useful as a radar...I think he'll allow me to remain by his side.$ I think I should go and talk to him.$ President Joo.$ Congratulations on your upcoming marriage.$ What?$ I didn't get to tell you this earlier because I was in a state of shock.$ So, congratulations on your upcoming marriage.$ I hope that you'll be very happy.$ Why are you acting like this?$ You're frightening me.$ Since you're now going to become someone else's home sweet home.I'm sure that you'll feel burdened by having to play the role of my defensive shield.$ But, I really hope that you won't get rid of your shield completely.$ Can you leave your shield available for me somewhere below?$ I'll try to stay away from you in a safe distance so you wouldn't feel burdened.$ But, can I still use it very lightly whenever I needed it?$ Home sweet home?$ I don't like sweets.$ Then... just hurry up and have a son.$ If you have a son who has the same abilities as you do then you can hire me as his caretaker and I'll take care of him for free as his nanny.$ You barge in out of nowhere, and you're going way off tangent.$ And now, you're telling me to bear a son?$ Tae Gong Shil.$ Are you acting like this because of the secret that walnut cracking lady told me about?$ Did that wife tell you about my secret?$ No, I didn't hear it.$ A secret is meant to be keep hidden.$ There's no reason for me to dig around it.$ I politely declined her offer and told her that I didn't want to hear it.$ - Aren't you grateful?$ - You said that?$ It wasn't anything that special.$ I didn't hear what the secret was... but the way you're acting is making it way too obvious.$ Your lousy lies makes me really wonder if you really want to keep your secret hidden.$ You barge in here to tell me what?$ 'Congratulations' and' Be happy'?$ That pattern is just like that famous candy girl... who's always talking about how she won't cry no matter how sad or lonely she is.$ No.$ This might actually be even easier.$ You go out of your way to congratulate me.$ You even told me that you won't interfere in my new home sweet home... and now, you're telling me that you want be to an honorary aunt to my future son.$ Just so that you don't feel too embarrassed...I'm just going to pretend that I didn't see or hear anything.$ Satisfied?$ You seem to be mistaken about something.$ The person whom I told that wife that I liked... it isn't you, but it's someone else.$ You know who it is, don't you?$ I... really like sweet things.$ To be honest...I stick to you because you're my defensive shield.$ But as a woman, I really can't stand filthy, lousy jerks like yourself.$ Good.I'm grateful to hear that I'm not your type.$ Then, I'll just leave before you can tell me to get lost.$ I always hated hearing you say that.$ Wait.$ Get lost.$ If she was going to use an excuse, she should've thought of something else.$ But why of all things, did it have to be Kang Candy?$ Hello.$ Ms. Tae Gong Shil, Madame Joo would like to see you.$ If you're amazing enough to become Ruijjang's muse.Then, I'm going to assume that you might have an artistic eye.$ Anyways, I called you in here to have you take a look at this.$ Why don't you open it and take out what's inside?$ This box?$ It's a piece of pottery.$ Joong Won's fiancee's family sent that to us as an engagement gift.$ An artistic piece like that shouldn't be compared in monetary value but this piece is extremely...$ Do you know how much this thing is worth?$ I'm sorry.$ It just gave me a bit of a shock.$ You do look shocked.$ It's too overwhelming of a piece for you to handle, isn't it?$ What would you have done if you had broken it?$ Isn't it terrifying even just thinking about it?$ Makes you think that maybe you never should've touched it in the first place, right?$ Yes.$ Don't touch things like that.$ It's not good for you.$ - What?$ - Ms. Tae Gong Shil.$ This porcelain is too precious for you to just refer to it' as that thing'.$ I know that people think that this thing is precious and valuable.$ This is nothing but a jug that was used to carry water around in.$ Stop saying that it's too precious to be touched by just anybody.$ It's just going to get more arrogant and cocky.$ What?$ Are you directing that towards me right now?$ No, I was just referring to this pottery piece.$ Okay, fine.$ Don't even think about using this vase as an excuse to break up Joong Won's engagement.$ I was just trying to find a nice roundabout way of telling you that.$ But, what?$ Arrogant and cocky?$ I'm sorry.$ I was just talking about this pottery piece.$ This was originally just a water vase that was used to carry water.$ The feelings of a person looking at it can be transferred over to the vase which could bring out strange and unnatural things.$ If you get lured in the wrong way, you'll have no choice but to break it.$ Are you not getting what I'm saying because I'm saying it too nicely?$ Are you saying that you'll do whatever it takes to break up Joong Won's wedding?$ You're a real troublemaker, aren't you?$ It seems that you're not getting what I'm saying because you can't see it.$ I just went to see him to congratulate him on his upcoming wedding.$ You could get yourself into big trouble if you handle this pottery the wrong way.$ You really need to be cautious of it.$ That thing really should be broken to pieces.$ You could get possessed by it.$ Bang Shil... fighting.$ Something scary is in this thing?$ Possessed?$ That Bang Shil is talking about herself.$ Did you get called into the VP's office and get reamed out?$ I was a little scared.$ What did she do?$ Did she throw money at you or something?$ No.$ I saw a ghost.$ I gave her a warning, but she didn't seem to hear me.$ Really?$ Everyone's going around whispering about you.$ They're saying that President Joo dumped you when you threw yourself at him.$ In everyone's eye...I'm just a candy girl who threw herself at him.$ Ghosts are the only ones that I can count on to understand me at times like this.$ Now that there's talks of marriage...you'll have to get rid of her, right?$ I have no intentions of doing that.$ I just mentioned the marriage just so I can play it safe.$ You're going to continue to keep her at your side?$ - Did she tell you that she won't go?$ - I'm the one who won't send her away.$ Since I can't go without seeing herI got engaged just so that I can put a safe distance between us.$ But, I'm going to continue to see her.$ For how long?$ Until...I no longer want to see her.$ I wonder if this is what scared her.$ When we told her how expensive it was she almost dropped it and broke it from the shock of hearing that.$ I doubt that she was shocked from the cost of it.$ I wonder if something is in here.$ - Joong Won.$ - Do you know how much this is worth?$ She's not someone that you can intimidate by flaunting your money.$ So, please don't do that anymore from now on.$ - What got into him?$ - President Joo... fighting.$ 'Big Sun' is dating Kingdom's president?$ What a joke.$ President Joo is marrying the heiress of Sejin Construction.$ Really?$ Mi Kyung, who works at the Kingdom hotel said she saw him throwing an event for her.$ I'm sure they just fooled around.$ To be honest, even if they did fool around, their level is just way too different.$ Why?$ What are you saying is wrong with' Big Sun'?$ She's smart, pretty, athletic with a great personality to boot.$ To be honest... she wasn't the' Big Sun' for no reason.$ When I heard that she was dating the president of KingdomI thought to myself that' Big Sun' has more than what it takes to date someone like him.$ You need to see Tae Gong Shil for yourselves to come to your senses.$ Want to meet up with her?$ Let's set a date.$ You're going to be quite shocked.$ You okay?$ What did you see in that pottery piece?$ Did something scary follow you in here?$ No, it didn't follow me in here.$ Tell your aunt that the pottery is dangerous and she needs to be careful.$ - She doesn't want to listen to me.$ - Why didn't you come to me?$ I didn't say you that I'll avoid you if you come to me when you needed me.$ You told me to keep the defensive shield available to you for you to use but why aren't you using it?$ Can I be honest with you?$ Go on, I'm listening.$ I don't want the person I like to misunderstand.$ Are you going to continue to argue that Kang Candy is the one you like?$ Are you going to continue to misunderstand and think you're the one I like?$ Misunderstanding?$ I once read a comic about a wolf that met a lamb on a stormy day.$ The wolf needed to catch and eat the lamb in order to survive but he fell in love with the lamb.$ So, he couldn't kill it and almost starved to death.$ To survive, he needs to see his prey for what it is.$ He can't look at the lamb as an object of his affection.$ Isn't that foolish of him?$ I'm not going to be that foolish.$ So what you're saying is...You, the wolf... is going to think of me, the lamb... as just part of the food chain that you need for your survival?$ Yes.$ So, stop asking me if the wolf likes the lamb.$ Okay, fine.$ Let's just say that's how the wolf felt, but what about the lamb?$ In that story, the lamb liked the wolf too.$ Then what happened?$ The lamb really liked the wolf.$ So, the lamb told the wolf...$ 'Wolf, I want you to eat me.'$ That lamb must be crazy.$ The wolf isn't going to eat the lamb just because of what it said.$ Not when the wolf liked the lamb.$ I can tell you about the secret I heard.$ - I don't want to know.$ You're afraid that once you know...the calculations won't add up, right?$ Right.$ Maybe I should've heard her out.$ Ugh, whatever.$ The chairman told me that he'll be back in Korea if his son is truly planning on getting married.$ What should I report to him in regards to this upcoming wedding?$ The truth is... this marriage is a fake.$ It's just business for both parties.$ If I accept your proposal... does it mean that Sejin Construction will have a new owner?$ I wasn't living abroad to study.$ I've been living in exile.$ But if I use the wedding as an excuse to come back to KoreaI can avoid my stepmother's control.$ Then I can figure out the false names written under bed-ridden father's stocks and gain control.$ I'm going to transform Sejin Construction to Sejin Cement Company.$ Will a week's time be enough for the false wedding pretense?$ If you'll help me, I'll lend you my support by giving Kingdom the wings it needs to expand your presence in Shanghai.$ I accept your proposal.$ In a week's time... this wedding could turn into nothing.$ You can tell to the chairman.$ There's no need for him to go out of his way and change his schedule.$ Is Ms. Tae Gong Shil aware of this?$ No, she's not aware.$ Make sure that you don't say anything before Master Joo talks to her.$ I understand.$ I prefer the simplicity of the white porcelain over the flash of celadon.$ Doesn't it remind you of a dignified scholar?$ Don't touch it so carelessly.$ She said it's not good to touch it.$ - You should just look at it.$ - That's just a bunch of crock.$ Honey.$ What do you think you're doing?$ Who cares?$ - No one's even around.$ - What about me?$ Didn't I tell you that I can't stand any indecent behaviors?$ Go scratch in the bathroom.$ Okay.$ How is it that I fell for a man like that?$ He's not my usual type.$ I've always loved men who are more like dignified scholars.$ Who are you?$ Why did a dignified scholar like yourself...call me out here?$ When are you ever going to fix that annoying sleep habit of yours?$ I've always had that habit.$ Why are you waking me up and yelling at me about it now?$ It wasn't long ago when you told me I looked cute in my sleep.$ How undignified.$ Go sleep in the guest room!$ I was having a nice meeting with a gentle scholar.$ You were meeting with whom?$ I need to get into the Vice President's office.$ I'll come with you.$ No, you can't.$ I think it would be better for you not to go.$ Is there... a ghost in there?$ I saw something in there.$ That's why I just want to stop in there and check something out.$ Give me the key to the office, and I'll go by myself.$ I'll come with you.$ If I don't go check it for myself...I won't be able to walk past the Vice President's office anymore.$ I'll go get the key.$ Let's go.$ Are you going to continue to stay here?$ I've got a lot of things that I need to take care of since coming back.$ You may go home since you're already done for the day.$ Okay.$ I wonder if I should ask Ms. Tae if she needs a ride home.$ No, I'm sure Team Leader Kang will take her home.$ He wanted me to hear that.$ I didn't hear anything.$ What is this?$ Did she go home already?$ Kang Woo.$ You can hold onto me if you're scared.$ Then please excuse me while I lean on you for a bit.$ I don't want to cling onto you like a kid.$ I'm more used to this position.$ Okay.$ But... can you loosen up your grip a little?$ Okay, I'll loosen up my grip.$ Let's see here.$ I don't see the vase, nor the ghost around here.$ You don't see anything?$ - Doesn't any of this scare you at all?$ - I'm scared, too.It's just that I'm a little bit more used to all this than you are.$ Is that why you've been living in hiding?$ Out of fear?$ I've lived for so long hiding out in my little apartment.$ Since I met President Joo...things have gotten much better.$ I noticed how my life changed once I found a little room to breathe in.$ President Joo can give you something that I can never give you.$ But... he's getting married soon.$ I don't think I can continue to stay by his side like I do now.$ In a week's time... the wedding is going to become nothing.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ How about you test yourself to see if you can live without him?$ This past week you were still able to come to work, and function just fine while he was away on his business trip.$ I don't know if I'll be able to refrain myself from sticking myself to him if I have him nearby.$ Why don't you give yourself about a week to think about it?$ If you decide that you'll be fine without him, then even if things end up changing... you shouldn't go to his side.$ It'll only hurt you.$ Why don't you wait for me and we can go home together?$ There's a new diner that opened right by our house that's pretty good.$ - Let's stop there on our way home.$ - There's a ghost at that diner.Then how about you take us to where there aren't any ghosts?$ There aren't any ghosts at the diner next door that sells kimbap.$ - But the food is horrible there.$ - Kimbap sounds good to me.$ Here, hold onto me.$ Is Kang Woo here?$ Team Leader Kang is doing his rounds.$ You're around quite a bit lately.$ Why?$ Do you think that I look like just another lady in the neighborhood too?$ No, you're a goddess.$ You're the goddess of our security office.$ What is that?$ That belongs to Team Leader Kang.$ It's cute.$ I'm sorry to ask you this, Yi Ryung...but can I take a picture with you?$ If you keep acting like this... you won't be able to do anything with her.$ - What the heck?$ - Kang Woo.$ You're so adorable!$ Did you just do this...because you got scared?$ - Do it again.$ - Forget it.$ Why are you here again?$ There may be an article about you and I in the tomorrow's papers.$ - What?$ - People took picture of us on that train.$ I'm meeting with a reporter friend of mine in the morning.$ If you'll come out for a drink with me right nowI'll just say that you're my personal bodyguard.$ But if you turn me down again, I'm going to say that you're my boyfriend.$ I bet that bit of news will become the number one searched topic on the web.$ In that case, I'm going to go out for a late night snack with Tae Gong Shil.$ Why don't you come along and have some pickled radish at the table next to us?$ Aren't you her friend?$ Kang Woo.$ That came out well.$ Let's go.$ Let's go show it to Gong Shil.$ Let's show her how the color on my lips is a perfect match to the one on your shirt.$ Really?$ Then we can go out for kimbap some other time.$ Yes, I understand.$ I'll go on home first.$ President Joo is still here?$ Is he not here?$ - I thought you were a ghost!$ - You'd like it better if I was a ghost.$ Because then you wouldn't have to worry about sharing me with anyone else and you can have me all to yourself.$ If you really were a ghost it wouldn't be me hanging onto you, but you'd be the one clinging onto me.$ I'm pretty popular with the ghosts.$ The ghosts see me as a brightly glowing sun.$ So, why am I being like this when I'm not even a ghost?$ - Excuse me?$ - Come in.$ Sit down.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ Want to be my candy girl anyways?$ Move out of that hole you live in.$ I'll get you a nice house.$ I'm sure you'll be needing a car, too.$ Pick whatever you want.$ Want to go back to school?$ Go ahead, I'll pay for it.$ Is there a really big ghost that you need me to help you catch?$ Tae Gong Shil, can't you react like a normal person?$ At times like this, you should either say,'Thank you.' or' Why are you doing this'.$ I don't need a big house because it just means more room for ghosts to hide in.$ I have a driver's license, but I'm too scared that something's going to pop out at me while driving, so I don't need a car.$ And as for going back to school, I've been thinking about that, too.$ I think I'll be able to handle taking the exams even if I had a ghost next to me.$ All the responses that you're giving me are answers that I can't compute.$ I want the relationship between you and I to be clearer.$ A poor and tacky woman comes barging into my life and a successful wealthy man like myself won't leave your side when everyone else around him is telling him that it's ridiculous to get involved.$ If I offer to buy you a car and a house you should react by either complaining about it or getting all cutesy.$ You only speaks of the ghost when my aunt is insulting you.$ It's difficult for me to comprehend.Make it easy for me, and be the candy girl.$ Then I'll be able to get rid of you with certainty when the time comes.$ I'm not afraid when I can clearly see the end.$ You're trying to make it easier for you to get rid of me later on?$ If I go into your world and become the only person you can rely on in your world then I can't... tell you to get lost.$ That's why...$ It will be easier.Let's just play up here, okay?$ If I was to become your candy girl, you can just tell me to get lost at any time.$ I'm not going to do it.$ Then what is it that I'm supposed to do?$ When I told you that I'm getting married... you asked me to leave a small room for you to use as your shield.$ And when I tell you to be my candy girl and just fool around you tell me that you have no intentions of getting lost.$ What is it that you want?$ Are you waiting for me to turn into a lamb and offer myself up to you?$ I don't expect anything from you.$ Why are you having such a hard time?$ Are you feeling burdened because you're afraid that I might like you?$ I don't like you.$ I'll just go catch the vase ghost like the way I caught that water ghost.$ It's not here.$ Just go home.$ Let's go.$ See?$ Even after everything that you just heard me say to you you still didn't ask me what I'm doing and why I'm holding your hand.$ The truth is...I saw a very scary looking lady ghost on my way up here.$ Let's go.$ - Where did you see it?$ - By the door.$ I don't think I've ever seen her around here before.$ Then I guess we'll have to hold hands the whole way home.$ Yes.$ If it makes you uncomfortable, I can just hold onto one of your fingers.$ Did you see any other ghosts while I was away on my business trip?$ Yes, I did.$ I was able to endure it while clutching tightly onto your pen.$ My pen?$ The talisman.$ President Joo, I've been thinking about it...I was able to get on just fine on my own this past week with your pen alone.$ So, I think that given some timeI think I'd be able to leave you on my own before you tell me to get lost for good.$ So, there's no need for you to worry.$ There will be an end to this.$ The necklace.$ I guess she never found the necklace.$ I wonder if he finds me...that burdensome.$ Let's all keep our minds focus on targeting America after China.$ You have three years to infiltrate the American market.$ Make sure that none of our competition gets wind of this.$ Chief Secretary Kim, please make sure that everyone gets this note.$ I want the building to look like a giant mirror that will blind everyone with its beauty.$ I heard that girl over there stayed at a hotel suite with President Joo.$ A suite?$ I even heard that he rented out the whole swimming pool for her.$ - Who?$ - Over there.$ But...I heard he dumped her.$ I heard he's getting married to some other woman.$ - What do you expect from a one night stand?$ - That's what I thought.$ But I still feel jealous.$ Why would you feel jealous of that?$ I think they're talking about me.$ How is it that you're so dignified, refined and elegant?$ Wow, that's good.$ Here, try some.$ How disgusting and uncouth.$ Why are you being like this now?$ Earlier, you tell me that I was being disgusting for using the bathroom often.$ Why do you nitpick at everything that I do lately?$ Why are you being so catty as a man?$ I've lost my appetite.$ Her name is Gong Shil, too.$ I know about Dooley, but I didn't know there was a Gong Shil.$ You seemed to be struggling a lot lately.$ I brought Gong Shil to help cheer you up.$ Thank you.$ She looks a lot like Dooley.$ Gong Shil is Dooley's girlfriend.$ Really?$ Take good care of Gong Shil for me, okay?$ Okay, I'll make the reservation at the restaurant.$ I'll see you later.$ Is this your office?$ It's really dingy in here.$ I heard that all our friends from high school are getting together for dinner.$ They're all curious to see how you're doing.$ Are you going to come?$ I'll come.$ I think it's about time for me to start going out to things like that.$ Really?$ Once I figure out the time and the place, I'll text you and let you know.$ But... there's something that I'm really curious about.$ What is your relationship with President Joo Joong Won?$ We just... see each other for what we are.$ I heard that he dumped you when you flung yourself at him?$ That's what everyone says.$ If that's how everyone sees it, then I guess that's what it is.$ That's too bad.$ I heard that President Joo's been cursed by his lost first love...$ That's why he's had several broken engagements.$ But it looks like his current engagement might really work out this time.$ Too bad that the curse got lifted when you go into the picture.$ No kidding.$ What's that?$ Gong Shil.$ Her name is Gong Shil, too.$ Is this a Dooley knockoff?$ No, she's Dooley's girlfriend.$ Yes.$ I'll be there to pick you up from the airport.$ Okay, I'll see you then.$ Once I'm in Korea, I may have to stay there for a while.$ Are you going to find this woman?$ If she's still alive...then I'll find her.$ Master Joo...$ The rumor about Master's Joo's being cursed by Cha Hee Joo always gets talked about whenever there's talk of Master Joo getting married.$ I'm sure people will start talking again now.$ But to President Joo, Cha Hee Joo isn't a curse but an old scar.$ If it's a scar... then all he needs is for someone to come around and help heal him.$ But I don't know if it's really a curse because he shuts everyone out and doesn't let anyone get close to him.$ You're right.$ He's always telling people to get lost.$ A stubborn person who always say that he'll never change... and a person who never lose the courage and stays whenever she's told to get lost...$ When those two come head to head...who do you think will win at the end?$ Are you referring to President Joo and I?$ I'm totally on your side.$ By the way...I heard that you're going out to a classmate reunion tomorrow?$ Where are you meeting them?$ A reservation has been made for you and Park Seo Yeon for tomorrow.$ It's been almost a week now.Are you going to quit this engagement now?$ You're not planning on continuing with this charade, are you?$ I know exactly what it is that you're thinking.$ I'm not telling you.$ Honey.$ I wonder what her deal with me is lately?$ You have to break that thing.$ It'll possess you.$ Since this is your engagement gift...you can keep it here.$ Is my aunt acting really weird?$ She's been disrespectful to me ever since she came into contact with this thing$ Whenever I try to do anything, she tells me how tacky and uncouth I am.$ She even told me once that she can't stand the sight of me.$ She's never said that to me before.$ According to Gong Shil... she said that we need to break this thing if any problem occurred.$ Even though what she said is weighing on meI can't exactly break it because she said that.$ Tae Gong Shil...$ - told you to break this?$ - That's what she said.$ But how can we break this thing when you're not breaking off your engagement?$ You take responsibility for it.$ I'll have her break it and tell her to take responsibility.$ I heard that you told them to break this?$ Should I really break it?$ Is your aunt really sick?$ Yes, I heard that she's really sick.$ I heard that she's in a critical condition.$ She can't even get out of bed lately.$ I don't know if I should break this or not.$ Then you should break it, but...$ Know that once I break this, it breaks off my engagement too.$ Break it or not?$ Then you can't break it.$ My aunt... is very, very sick.$ She's pretty much on her deathbed.$ She's my one and only aunt.$ Then you need to break it.$ Then, it's decided.$ I'm taking your word for it, and breaking it.$ Once my engagement is broken off, you have to take responsibility for that, too.$ Why do I have to take responsibility for all that?$ Because I'm breaking it since I have no other choice.$ - I'm breaking it.$ - No... no!$ Honey!$ Honey!$ - Honey!$ - What?$ What is it?$ - Honey!$ - What's wrong?$ It's okay.Are you okay?$ What was that?$ What was that thing?$ There's nothing in here.$ Gong Shil.$ You just told him to break it to get rid of the ghost.$ But people are going to think that you told him to break off his engagement.$ But that's not what you meant to do, right?$ I think I finally get how others view you as they see you standing next to him.$ What should we do?$ Kang Woo.$ Is... something in there?$ Gong Shil was just talking to Gong Shil.$ It's been a week now.How do you feel?$ Do you think that you'll be able to survive without him?$ I'm not really sure if I'll be able to survive without him.$ But I finally realized how others view Gong Shil as she stand by his side.$ Gong Shil... fits in best when she remains by Dooley's side.$ Didn't you say that you have your reunion tonight?$ Seung Mo told me that you're very nervous about it.$ He's right.$ I haven't seen any of those friends in a really long time.$ When a group of girls gets together... they all brag about their boyfriends, right?$ Yes, I'm sure they do.$ Then... you should brag about your boyfriend, too.$ Who?$ Dooley?$ If Dooley shows up at dinner tonight, I bet it'll knock all your friends over.$ But...I think I remember liking Ddochi more than Dooley.$ This isn't going to work.$ In order for Dooley to prove his worth, I'll have to make sure that he shows up there.$ Team Leader Kang.$ You're going out to pickup the Chairman today, aren't you?$ - Yes.$ - Do you have any plans afterwards?$ With Ms. Tae?$ Yes.$ Sine you have a good reputation...I want you to tell people that my sister and President Joo isn't like that.$ Just who in the world is going around spreading those rumors?$ No kidding.$ I have no idea who's going around blabbing those rumors.$ People are just so gossipy these days.$ I've been keeping my ears open$ I think it's someone from the Vice President's security team.$ Really?$ I didn't know there was such a blabbermouth like that in our office.$ Find out who it is for me.$ I'll go teach that person a lesson.$ If you'll find out who it is, I'll take care of all your coffee needs.$ Here, have this too.$ There you are.$ Vice President wants to see you in his office after lunch.$ - Why would the he want to see you?$ - I'm not sure.$ I wonder why?$ Then go and find out who the blabbermouth is.$ I'm going to get going.$ I'll take this with me.$ Honey.$ What now?$ Even the way you slurp your noodle is just so manly.$ It was your sexy lips that made me fall for you.$ You're back!$ I guess breaking that vase really was the right thing to do like she said.$ But why did Joong Won break that precious engagement gift?$ I'm not sure.$ I guess he wanted to break off the engagement.$ Honey.$ Didn't you say that your brother is coming back today?$ It's been a year since his last visit.$ I'm sure he's not coming back to help Joong Won with his wedding plans.$ I wonder what he's coming back for?$ Long time no see, Kang Woo.$ Shall we go?$ Thanks to you, everything went very well.$ If it's agreeable with Kingdom, I'd like to keep the marriage plans going.$ But it's a little disappointing to hear that you want to stop now.$ Neither one of us has anything to be disappointed about.$ Since this was just a business arrangement and we both profit quite a bit from it.$ Why don't we calculate and see how profitable this has been for both of us?$ 'Big Sun'!$ It's been so long!$ Come sit down over here.$ Are you okay?$ What's wrong?$ No, it's okay.$ It's nothing.$ Anyways, since our engagement has been called offI guess I can't say that I'll see you around.$ I wonder if this makes me another victim to President Joo Joong Won's curse?$ That curse is famous.$ Master Joo of Kingdom is cursed by his dead first love.$ You've already had four broken engagements, right?$ I hope that you can break off the curse before your next engagement.$ That woman... just told me that she's the fourth victim to the curse.$ If all the women who's fallen victim to the curse gets together and gambles...I bet they'll all be able to win their bets.$ I doubt it'll be any fun for them to get together.$ Since they were all dumped by you.$ A heart that won't ever receive another's heart is a curse in itself.$ Without change... the curse can never be lifted.$ The reason why I put you on Joong Won's trail... is because of this picture.$ This is Maria.$ I accidentally ran across this picture in one of Maria's photo albums.$ Who does this girl remind you of someone?$ It's Cha Hee Joo.$ Where was this picture taken?$ - Was it taken in England?$ - That's right.$ A girl that looked just like her was in England.$ This picture was taken a year after Cha Hee Joo's death.$ Then... does this mean that Cha Hee Joo's still alive?$ Didn't you tell me that Joong Won came in contact with dead Cha Hee Joo through a woman named Tae Gong Shil?$ I discovered a living Cha Hee Joo in Europe.$ Then could it be that...Cha Hee Joo has a twin?$ That's the most plausible explanation.$ But I discovered something very strange.$ What is all this?$ Those are all the Christmas cards... that Maria received from the girl in the picture for the past ten years.$ The girl in the picture moved around and lived all over the world.$ If you look at it in the chronological order that these cards were sent... she lived in L.A. for three years, in New York for four years and she's lived in China for three years.$ After the kidnapping incident, Joong Won lived abroad in other countries.$ Three years in L.A., four years in New York, and three years in China.$ She's been following President Joo around?$ This woman here?$ She wrote to say that she was moving back to Korea in her last card to Maria.$ That was sent five years ago.$ And that's when Joong Won moved back to Korea himself.$ Do you believe... that this woman is watching over President Joo?$ That's right.$ I believe that Cha Hee Joo is still alive.$ Ever since the incident, she's been following Joong Won's every move and that she's still in very close proximity to him.$ Who is she?$ - I've never seen her around here before.$ - She moved in here recently.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ So, this is where she was having her classmate reunion.$ I just received news that your father has arrived at the hotel.$ Team Leader Kang Woo will be here soon.$ Would you like to stay and speak to him about how your father is doing?$ I'll meet with my father and speak to him myself directly.$ There's no need to tell Team Leader Kang Woo to come here.$ He's not coming because I asked him.Team Leader Kang Woo is coming here to see Ms. Tae.$ I think he's planning on joining them for dinner.$ I bet that'll make Ms. Tae look good in front of her classmates tonight.$ To have them see how good looking her boyfriend is.$ So, I heard that you were in a bad accident?$ But are you okay now?$ Yeah, I'm much better now.$ It's such a shame that you never got to graduate from school with your smarts.$ What's the age limit on how late you have to get reinstated at school?$ There's still some time left.$ Gong Shil.$ - Tell us some stories about yourself.$ - You work at Kingdom, right?$ Is President Joo of Kingdom really your boyfriend?$ Why don't you tell them exactly what you told me?$ Just how you threw yourself at him...and how he dumped you.$ She's right.$ I was dating a man who's very successful and extremely rich.$ How did you meet?$ It was a rainy night.$ And I was able to hitch a ride in a really fancy car.$ And it turns out that the man in that car was the president of Kingdom.$ I knew I had to see him again, so I went to find him.$ I knew that I had to grab onto him.$ So I got a part time job there, and chased him around.$ When I told him how sad and lonely I was, he finally allowed me to be near him.$ Your defensive shield is here.$ Hide.$ He helped me out whenever I was struggling with something and he remained by my side.$ He even rented out a whole swimming pool at his hotel to throw me a surprise event.$ Now that you've heard my story...how do I look to you guys?$ - I'm totally jealous.$ - It must be so nice for you.$ Then what?$ The ending is the most important part.$ He's... soon going to marry a rich heiress.$ That's what I thought.$ But I still haven't gone away, and I'm sticking right by his side.$ Because I can't leave him.$ That's a little...$ Even if that makes me look pathetic and shameless there's nothing I can do about it.$ Because to me... that man is very special.$ He's unlike anyone else in this world.$ That would be me.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ I just broke off my engagement because of you.$ So, take responsibility.$ Let's go.$ What are you doing here?$ As expected, there you go with your complaints.$ Then should I get all cutesy with you now?$ I can see that my baby is very upset.$ As a way of appeasing her, let me treat you all to dinner.$ Please stay and enjoy yourselves.$ My baby... shall we go?$ Let's go.$ What are those two doing right now!$ Once we omit anything about you being a radar, and me a shieldIt's much simpler for others to understand what we have between us.$ You can stop it now.$ I get it.$ I see this is all I amount to in your world.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ What's wrong?$ What's the matter?$ Is something wrong?$ I'm taking her with me.$ Kang Woo.$ What's going on?$ Why is Tae Gong Shil upset?$ What is President Joo doing here?$ He said he broke off his engagement for her.$ He said he came to get her so that she can take responsibility.$ What about you?$ Why did you come here?$ Did you come here for her, too?$ Yeah, I did.$ Do you really like Tae Gong Shil?$ Yes, I do.$ Now that you know...$ Will you stop asking me to be your boyfriend now?$ You told me that I could still use you.$ All I need is a tiny space for me to breathe in.$ Are you so afraid that I might want you for something else?$ That's right, I am afraid.$ Can you really remain by my side and not want for anything else?$ Can you really just use me as your shield?$ Can you really go away on your own once you figured out how to be by yourself?$ I told you that I would.$ I'm trying to do that right now.$ Can I trust you on that?$ No matter how badly you just stomped over me right now,$ I will still run right into your arms if something scary jumps out at me.$ That's what I'm like.$ It's not like you're unaware of that.$ Okay, fine.$ I'll trust you.$ I'm just going to do whatever I want from now on.$ You can take care of everything on your own from now on.$ Thank you.$ I can handle anything.$ Is that so?$ Then start by seeing how well you can handle this.$ Ms. Tae.It seems that I'm in love with you.$ What are you going to do now?$ Subtitles by DramaFever$ 
5436450$ Subtitles by DramaFever$ I'm...leaving.$ I think I should just be a sun that only shines for those who are already dead.$ I only want to remain as a brilliant sun only for those ghosts.$ When I'm by your side...I feel like I become a sun of misfortune who only invites death to those around me.That makes me really fear and hate myself.$ So, it's not just that you're slightly disappointed when I'm not around... but I make you fear and hate yourself?$ I don't want to remain by your side only to become that kind of a sun.$ Just... tell me to get lost now.$ The only reason why I was able to... tell you to get lost all this time without any fear... was because I knew... without a doubt in my mind... that you'd rise again by my side.$ I'll give it a try...and do as you wish me to do.$ Get lost... my sun.$ Master Joo.$ I heard that Ms. Tae is leaving for somewhere very far away.$ Weren't you here with Ms. Tae?$ Where is she?$ Episode 16.$ Make sure to call me often, okay?$ You're not going to stay away for too long, right?$ I don't think I'll know how long I'll be until I actually get there.$ Is he the one that's going with you?$ That man...he's the one from your accident, right?$ That's why you shouldn't worry.$ I'll be back, okay?$ Okay.$ Bye.$ - Take care, Gong Ri.$ - Okay.$ Go.$ I'll call you.$ She left you?$ I thought Tae Gong Shil would be fine as long as I handled everything.$ But... she told me that she's afraid, and it's too much for her.$ When I thought about it...I never once tried to understand, nor took it into consideration... the situation that she may be in.$ Then... are you saying that you're being considerate, and understanding of Ms. Tae's situation and that's why you're letting her go?$ Do I look crazy to you?$ To let Tae Gong Shil leave me like this?$ Why would I do something that I've never done in 34 years of my life in such a pivotal moment like this?$ I don't understand nor want to be considerate of her wanting to leave me.$ Please answer your phone.$ Did you end things... with that man?$ How could I have ended it?$ I just... forced myself to walk away from him.$ I wish the plane would just take off already.$ It should get better once I put some distance between us, right?$ I told Kang Woo that I was leaving today, but he hasn't even called.$ His crappy dog manners.$ Tae Gong Shil left on a flight headed for L.A.$ Get me a seat on the next flight out.$ I'm going to follow her.$ Yes, I'll get you a seat on the flight as soon as I get your passport from the office.$ - Joong Won is going to America?$ - Yes.$ Deputy Ahn received a phone call from Chief Secretary Kim.$ She just left for the airport with President Joo's passport.$ Why is he going to America all of a sudden?$ What could this be about?$ I'm not sure.$ No, it's nothing.$ Once you go and pass the audition, instead of returning to Korea... let's just stay there and hone your acting skills.Okay?$ I need to use the bathroom.$ - Tae Gong Shil.$ - Yi Ryung.$ What are you doing here?$ Are you going to America, too?$ Are you going to there on a business trip with President Joo?$ No, I'm just going there to take care of some personal business.$ I read in the newspaper that you're going to America to film a movie.$ Oh, that.$ I'm just going there for an audition.$ - Is he with you?$ - Yeah.$ My seat is over there.$ Come over to chat if you get bored.$ We went to school together.$ I got you a seat on a flight that leaves in two hours.$ - Nothing sooner?$ - No, nothing as of now.$ You just let Tae Gong Shil leave?$ She told me that she was going to leave as soon as Cha Hee Joo's case was resolved.$ So... you just let her leave instead of grabbing onto her and asking her to stay?$ I'm not letting her leave.$ I'm going to follow her and bring her back.$ Even if you were to follow her there, she has a two hour head start on you.$ What if you lose track of her during that time gap?$ This is a tracking device.$ Take this with you.$ I wasn't sure what was going to happen, so I put a tracking device in Gong Shil's bag.$ Tae Gong Shil doesn't know that I did that.$ Go and make sure that you find her, and bring her back.$ You're a very clever man, Team Leader Kang.$ Come back and work for me at Kingdom again.$ I'll double your salary.$ Turn it on for me.$ [ Tae Yi Ryung ]$ Kang Woo.$ Did you know that Tae Gong Shil is on her way to America?$ - How do you know that?$ - She's on the same flight that I'm on!$ She's going to America with some man whom I've never seen before.$ Really?$ Tae Gong Shil is on the same flight that Tae Yi Ryung is on right now.$ The plane is still on the ground.$ Hello?$ Hello?$ Hey!$ Hey, you dog...$ President Joo Joong Won?$ Ms. Tae Yi Ryung, listen to me very carefully.$ I need your gifted acting skills right now.$ Excuse me?$ Hey.$ Do you consider me a good actress?$ What?$ Make sure you don't get yourself involved in the act that I'm about to put on, okay?$ Yi Ryung!$ What's wrong?$ Gong Shil.$ My stomach hurts.$ What?$ What's wrong with your stomach?$ I don't know.But it really hurts!$ I think it's my appendicitis!$ Help!$ Someone help us!$ Please!$ We need some help!$ - Is she okay?$ - She needs help.$ Gong Shil.$ It's okay, Yi Ryung.$ Just hang on.$ - Big Sun.$ - Yes?$ Stay with me.$ Big Sun.$ Gong Shil!$ Don't leave me, Gong Shil!$ - Don't let me die!$ - It's okay, just hang on.$ Gong Shil!$ Gong Shil!$ - Big Sun!No!$ Come with me!$ - You go on ahead.$ You're her guardian, so you get in with her.$ Tae Gong Shil!$ I never knew that a day would come when I'd be impressed by Tae Yi Ryung's acting.$ You managed to get her to stay, but what are you going to do now?$ Be understanding, and considerate...I'm going to have to start doing those things.$ I want you to remain by my side and help me.$ I'm not good at things like that.$ So, if it seems like I'm doing it wrong, you have to get on my case and if I try to deviate from it, you have to stop me.$ Just like what you've been doing at my side for the past 15 years.$ Yes, I'll do that.$ But, Master Joo.I'm a little disappointed.$ I've been on your case for the past 15 years, but you didn't even budge.$ But look at how easily you've opened up your heart to Ms. Tae whom you've only known for a brief while.$ It wasn't easy.$ You know that I'm not that easy of a person.$ I'm not so sure.$ - Chief Secretary Kim.$ - Yes?$ Okay.$ Little Sun.$ You're acting way too normal for someone who was dying a minute ago.$ Can't you tell by looking?$ I was faking it.$ I've been taking acting lessons from an acting coach lately and my acting's gotten much better.$ I just got a script for a woman who has terminal illness.$ Maybe I should do that.$ Did you get me off that plane just so that you could practice your acting on me?$ Well, I didn't really want to go to that audition anyways.And President Joo Joong Won asked me to do it.$ He asked me to get you off that plane.$ - President Joo asked you to do that?$ - I didn't want to do it either.$ I don't like seeing you being happy with someone as successful as President Joo.$ It makes me envious of you.$ Then why did you do it?$ Because things need to get better for you, and you have to become safe and happy.$ In order for him to stop watching over you, and feel safe enough to leave your side...I couldn't think of any other solution other than finding you happiness with President Joo.$ That's why I helped him.$ If that's the case, then you shouldn't have gotten yourself involved.$ Because I was leaving so that I could be safe and happy.$ You seem to be saying that because you don't want to lose face in front of me.$ But that's not at all how you looked.$ 'I love you too much, and that's why I'm leaving you.'$ That's the candy fluff you're trying to play off right now.$ - Candy?$ - That's right.$ I'm not good enough, so I'm leaving for your own good.$ Make me stay if you really love me.$ If you do, then I'll relent and stay.$ I know that's what you're doing.$ President Joo did more than his share by getting you off of that plane.$ Stop playing hard to get, and let him grab onto you now.$ If you insist on dragging it out, it'll only exhaust everyone involved.$ Yi Ryung.$ I have a big fatal flaw, so I can't pretend to be weak and just grab onto him.$ A fatal flaw?$ I think I know what it is.$ You need both Kang Woo and President Joo to feel empathy for you and protect you.Isn't it?$ Okay, what is it?$ I... see dead people.$ What?$ There's one in here, too.$ I think he was a patient who passed away in this hospital room.$ I don't believe in things like that.$ Okay.$ Anyways, he wants me to pass along a message to you.$ He says he's a fan of yours.$ I'm leaving now.$ Hey, Tae Gong Shil!$ Where are you going?$ If you leave me all alone after telling me something like that.It's scary.$ I really hate ghost stories.$ When I was being clingy, but even when I'm leaving...I'm still nothing but a gold digging candy girl in everyone else's eyes.$ Woo Jin, it's you.$ But... why are you still here?$ It's Woo Jin's mom.$ Woo Jin.$ Seeing you reminds me of a terrifying memory.$ I don't want to see you.$ Mr. Joo Joong Won.$ You forcefully brought back the sun that was trying to leave.$ But, did you manage to have her rise at your side again?$ - Who are you?$ - I'm the man that's leaving with Gong Shil.$ I'm sure that Gong Shil must've told you.$ I've met someone who can see and hear the same things that I can.$ You're telling me that you see ghosts like Tae Gong Shil does?$ Unlike you...I'm someone who lives in the same world which Gong Shil lives in.$ Ms. Tae!$ - Chief Secretary Kim.$ - How could you have left without a word?$ Were you running away...$ to avoid Master Joo?$ I wasn't running away.$ - I was just going to search for something.$ - Search for what?$ The reason why I ended up this way.$ I was leaving to search for a reason why I was made to be able to see dead people.$ Are you saying if she goes to those places that she's been with you that she'll be able to find the reason why?$ I'm not sure of that myself.$ We can only know once we get there.$ When you're not even sure of it yourself you were still trying to take her that far away from here?$ That's not what's important.$ What's important is that for the very first time...$ Gong Shil has started to take a real look at herself and who she is.$ She's hid herself away living in torment while avoiding others all these years, hasn't she?$ And when you appeared, you were like a safe haven she could escape to.$ But, now...$ Gong Shil is considering stepping out on her own away from you.$ That's why I came to see Gong Shil.$ What is it... that you can do for Tae Gong Shil?$ Her memories from those three years that she roamed this earth as a spirit...I'm going to help her regain those memories.$ Since that's when she started seeing spirits... once she regains her memories of that time... it'll transform Gong Shil.$ - How so?$ - She won't be afraid anymore.$ She may be able to accept her ability to see spirits, or... it's possible that she may even lose that ability.$ You're saying that it's possible she may not be able to see ghosts anymore?$ Yes.$ Whether she accepts her ability, or loses her ability... the defense shield you can offer to Gong Shil will become meaningless to her.$ Is Tae Gong Shil aware of all this?$ Yes.$ That's why she's coming with me.$ So, you thought that I was leaving for President Joo's sake?$ I was really only thinking of myself when I tried to leave.$ Now that I think about it, Candy is much more of a romanticist than I am.$ To leave like that for the sake of someone else.$ I'm not that innocent, bright, nor kind hearted like that.$ You've changed a lot, just like how Master Joo has changed.$ You used to say that you were just grateful to have someone like you.$ The sun that was crumpled down below is now saying how she wants to rise high up in the sun and shine brilliantly.$ And there's nothing I can do about it either.$ I'm at a loss for what to do.$ Seriously.$ Then do you think President Joo could have the same misunderstanding?$ Do I really have to put on my Candy act?$ I'm not sure.$ I'm not sure where Master Joo stands.$ He's Master Joo.$ Even though I had to force you to come back...I feel like I can finally breathe again now that you're standing in front of me.$ Listen, President Joo.$ Why did you hold me back?$ I was trying to leave for your own sake because I knew I wasn't good enough for you.$ Who do you think you're talking to?$ Do you think that I'm going to run over to you and hold onto you from the back just because you're putting on that act?$ Was I being that obvious?$ Did the blunt and brazen sun all of a sudden become a moon of purity?$ I just thought that you'd feel less offended and be a little bit more understanding if I told you that I did what I did for your benefit sake.$ Even if you come off sounding really blunt, I like you better when you're being honest.$ I don't like it when you change who you are which only ends up confusing me.$ Okay, then I'll be blunt and tell you how it is.$ I...I'm leaving for the sake of my own survival.$ It's not that I hadn't thought of you at all... but my own well-being came first.$ Initially, I felt comfortable to cling onto you as my defensive shield.$ Because I just clung onto you without having to think about anything else.$ Then I started to have feelings for you, I think that's when it all started.$ That's when I started hating myself for my ability to see ghosts.$ You told me that you'd lower yourself as much as you can to suit me, right?$ But...I felt so pathetic about how low my life was.$ I can't live like this anymore.$ I need to find out why I ended up this way.$ I want to get rid of my ability to see ghosts if I can.$ Can you find your reason, and come back to me?$ I can't promise you that I'll come back to you.$ Because if I don't change from the way I am now... there's no way that I'll return to your side ever again.$ I told you, didn't I?$ I don't want to remain as the sun of misfortune at your side.$ The day that I got stabbed by the screwdriver...I never should've gone after you.$ And fortunately, your life didn't end then... you were able to find a way to continue on with your life the way you're meant to.$ Can you understand what I'm saying?$ I'm not a dumb street mutt.$ I got it, so you can give it a rest.$ Thank you.$ Seeing how you're able to walk around freely at a hospital when you once told me that it was the scariest place to you in the world...I guess you won't be coming back because you missed having your defensive shield.$ I need to find another weapon to bring us back together.$ Wait for me until I do.$ I'm going to leave just like I had planned.$ Then you'll be meeting some cops on your way to the airport.$ Why?$ Because... you're a sexual molester.$ You've touched every nook and cranny of my body.$ You even crawled onto my bed without my permission.$ You even paid me for the privilege of doing that, didn't you?$ 10,000 won.$ One million won.$ Didn't you just tell me that you understood?$ Even if I understood, I have no intention of being considerate.$ There's no way that I'll just send you off peacefully.$ I'm just going to start doing whatever I want from now on without a guilty conscience.$ You can handle everything from now on all on your own.$ Once I think that you're no longer afraid of ghosts, and that you'll be okay alone... that's when you can tell me to stop coming, and go back to my own neighborhood.$ That woman doesn't have any self-respect.$ There's a definite reason why she can't let me go... and that's why she doesn't have the luxury to care about any self-respect.$ I don't get scared when I'm sure of the ending.$ All I ever told her every day was for her to handle everything and that there was a sure ending for us.$ And now...I got what I asked for.$ But still...I got to tell her exactly how I felt.$ I love you.$ Would that... have been enough?$ I guess I must've gone as far as what I feared in my worst case scenario.$ I totally forgot that I said those words to her.$ The things I said to Madame Go...$ that was the worst thing I could've said.$ Death, the end, and not being attracted...I said some words that I never should've said if it hadn't been for that specific situation.$ I don't want to retrieve those words just to complicate things again.$ No, I'm sure she didn't hear me say that.$ The deal with Madame Go is all over now.$ I even paid her a huge amount of money so that she never comes back again.$ I need to say nicer words to her.$ That way I can ask her how can she treat me so coldly like this.$ I heard that Han Na Brown was the culprit?$ Ugh, it could've been really bad for President Joo.$ Can you imagine how bad it would be if they got together like you wanted them to?$ I can't even fathom how shocked my Joong Won must've been.$ You said that they were able to catch her all thanks to Tae Gong Shil's help, right?$ Yes.$ Honey.$ What Bang Shil did was amazing.$ Honey.$ Joong Won.$ Are you okay?$ Aunt.$ I'm really struggling right now, so let's do this some other time.$ Okay.$ President Joo.$ I'm sure that you must be exhausted.$ I'll take care of the Shanghai meeting, and the finalization of all the paperwork.$ I have both sides of my brain for that, one to ponder business... and the other side for my own personal life.$ I can take care of them both myself.$ So both of you... just leave.$ Go, I said.$ It seems as though President Joo is suffering from the huge shock.$ I think he needs someone who'll be at his side to comfort and console him.$ He has me.$ Yes, I know that he has you.$ What he needs now is a warm loving presence.$ Who are you referring to?$ I'm talking about Bang Shil.$ Deputy Ahn told me a few things.$ And I guess Tae Gong Shil was trying to... leave for somewhere far away after she resolved the case for him.$ President Joo went after her and got her back.$ My goodness... my heart just breaks for them.$ I was really touched after I heard the story about the two of you from Deputy Ahn.$ You getting on that plane, and Master Joo coming after you.$ That's just unbelievable.$ If you really want to test the boundaries of love getting on the plane and pretending to leave is a pretty good tactic to use.$ You know your stuff.$ It wasn't like that.$ Gong Shil.$ President Joo went through all that trouble to bring you back and make you stay.$ You shouldn't go.Okay?$ He's not the reason why I'm leaving.$ Hey, that man...$ You told me that he even knows about the things you see.$ If he's telling you that he still likes you even after knowing all that then shouldn't that be the end of it?$ Even in your eyes... do you think that he's above my limit, and I'm playing hard to get undeservingly?$ Ms. Tae Gong Shil, you should give it a rest and stop playing so hard to get, okay?$ Why are you talking to my sister like that?$ Ms. Tae Gong Shil.$ You're being asked to come to the vice president's office.$ - Me?$ - Yes.$ Why?$ Once she gets President Joo's aunt's approval... then I guess things will go the way that the vice president wanted it to go.$ I didn't think that it was possible for Master Joo and Gong Shil to work out.$ I was starting to wonder if I got on the wrong side of the fence but it ends up that I had chosen the golden side of the fence.$ Lee Han Joo, you were on the vice president's side?$ Of course, I'm the vice president's eyes, ears, mouth.$ I'm his head, shoulders, knees and toes...$ Then were you the blabbermouth from the vice president's office?$ All those times that you took me out to eat jokbal and everything else it was all so that you could go around blabbing that mouth of yours?$ So, you were just fishing for information?$ Wait, Tae Gong Ri!$ I'm not going to touch you, nor provoke you for the time being.$ So, stop with all that needless talk of leaving just to make things harder for my Joong Won right now.$ You two are telling me that you can't live without one another and it seems I've just made things even more poignant and heart wrenching by getting in the middle of it.$ So, I'm not going to do that anymore.$ I trust that my nephew won't go off the deep end... and he'll come back to his senses.$ No, don't do that.$ I don't have the luxury to love anyone to the point of it being heart wrenching.$ You once told me that I was ominous, didn't you?$ What you said was right.$ I've dragged President Joo into my life and made him stand on the brink on the death.$ Yet, here I am staring into that face all over again.$ I'm never going to repeat that same mistake again.$ Bang Shil.$ Do you have a grudge against me because I was a bit harsh with you in the past?$ Are you trying to get an apology from me or something?$ - Is that it?$ - No, I'm not.$ I know that it's only because you love President Joo very much.$ You're very precious to the person that I care deeply about.$ If anything, I'm grateful to you.$ Are you... trying to play me, too?$ No.$ I'm just going to leave you be, and get lost for good.$ It seems as though you're starting to have some doubts.$ Yes.$ Everyone can't seem to understand me.$ They all thought the same... that I was bluffing and playing hard to get.$ They think it's ludicrous that someone like President Joo would want me to stay.$ Then... do you want to try remaining at his side... and live your life together while enduring and handling what may come your way?$ Because it seemed to me that he was ready to do that.$ You know that I can't do that.$ My decision to leave was an extremely difficult decision for me to make.$ Even the thought of never being able to see him again... makes me feel completely empty inside.$ This kid... is he following you around?$ His name is Woo Jin.$ He follows me because he's really worried about his mom.$ - Are you not going to help this kid out?$ - No, I'm not.$ The last time I followed this kid, I almost caused Joong Won to die.$ I'm going with you because I don't want to do anything like that again.$ Then, I'll wait for you at the airport tomorrow.$ It's up to you whether you'll come with me or not.$ So you're the cause of Gong Shil's agony, huh?$ It seems as though even her final decision...$ will all come down to you again.$ She's sleeping?$ After threatening me to come with the necessities after a fake hospitalization... and she sleeps?$ It seemed like a big project led by a famous director.$ I wonder if she's making a huge mistake by letting go of this opportunity.$ Seeing how she's sleeping so peacefully...$ she seems perfectly fine to me.$ What the heck?$ Did you attack me just now?$ Even though I'm a little flustered by your surprise ambush... but I came prepared for it.$ So, I won't get mad at you.$ But... are you sure that was enough?$ I was prepared for something even more drastic with you being the black whiskered whale and all.$ But thanks for such a bland ending.$ What?$ You really won't get mad if I do something more than that?$ No, I wouldn't have gotten mad.$ It's an opportunity that you even gave up an international movie for... but that's too bad.$ Kang Woo!$ That didn't count.$ I'm going to do it right this time.$ There are reporters waiting outside.$ You can't come out there, okay?$ I should've just jumped on him.$ I was attempting to organize my thoughts in order to renegotiate with you.$ I discovered a huge injustice along the process.$ The more I think about it, the more ridiculous it all seems.$ What's ridiculous?$ You and I've been taking turns talking about our end.When in fact, we've never even really started.$ We've never once shared a meal, or held hands without having a ghost involved.$ Talking about our ending when there wasn't even a beginning...$ Don't you find that funny?$ Yes, it's funny.$ I've touched you, grabbed you, and poked you enough to get accused of sexual harassment.$ But I've never once touched you just because I wanted to from liking you.$ Forget all that talk about leaving and just grab my hand and let's just go grab dinner together.$ It feels weird.$ I think this is the first time I've ever held your hand without there being a ghost.$ See?$ Doesn't it feel unfair to just end it after only having held hands once?$ Since I've grabbed onto your hand, why don't we go have dinner together?$ I'll just go in and change real quick.$ Make it quick.$ Enjoy your meal.$ This is my favorite udon restaurant.$ This place is the best in this area.$ I love udon so much, that I find myself eating it about five times a week.$ This is the first time I've ever heard of how much you like udon.$ Do you like udon, too?$ I hate these fat noodles that sits in a bowl of this hot broth.$ I like the refreshing tasting and thin nangmyun noodles.$ - I see.So you like nangmyun?$ - That doesn't mean that I like all nangmyun.$ I only like it from this certain restaurant.$ It's number three on their menu.$ But... ever since the grandmother of that place passed away the flavor of the dish changed, so I've quit eating nangmyun.$ Really?$ Had I known sooner, I would've stopped by that nangmyun place.$ If that deceased grandmother was still there don't you think I could've found out why the flavor of the dish had changed?$ If you leave just like this... even my chances of ever eating another bowl of nangmyun also disappears.$ I find that to be unfair, too.$ Where's that nangmyun place?$ I'll stop by before I leave.$ Don't pretend to care when you're just going to leave and abandon me.$ Go on and eat before your fat noodles get fatter.$ I hope you really enjoy eating it... and that you feel a sense of longing whenever you eat another bowl of udon.$ I come to this place from time to time to get some exercise.$ I used to be really good at sports.$ I was especially good at tennis.$ I'm good at other thing besides tennis such as horseback riding, golf, and archery.$ I guess you would've concentrated more on being athletic since you couldn't read.$ I, on the other hand, only read because I couldn't go outside.$ That's too bad.$ We could've lived together with me reading all the books that you'd recommend and with me teaching you all the sports that I'm really good at.$ You're breaking the fundamental structure of' Give and Take' when you leave.$ I guess you're right.$ I've always wanted to learn how to horseback ride, and how to golf.$ I have horses, golf courses, swimming pools, and tennis courts.$ In other words, you could say that I have a lifetime membership to all those things.$ You even have horses?$ I saw the ghost of a horse once.$ But you can't ride the ghost of a horse.$ But you'd be able to ride the horses that I have.$ President Joo.$ There's an old lady sitting on that bench who likes to mess with couples on their dates.$ All the couples that sits on that bench ends up breaking up.$ Excuse me!$ They'll end up breaking up if I just leave them alone.$ Then let them break up.$ My relationship is about to be broken up as well.$ I don't want to see others having a happy ending.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ Don't go.$ Ms. Tae told me that she was leaving for the sake of her own benefit.$ That's why I'm sure Master Joo won't be able to force her to stay either.$ I've always thought that President Joo could do the things for Tae Gong Shil that I never could do for her myself.$ That's why I've taken a step back only to stare at her from afar.$ But... if Tae Gong Shil is saying that she herself is what she's really afraid of... then the only thing President Joo can do... is to take a step back and watch her as he waits for her like I've done.$ Master Joo has never once accepted a person's decision for what it is.$ Whether he'll be able to be understand and be considerate of her decision... is something that I'm not sure he'll be able to do.$ I didn't even know that jerk was the blabbermouth I've been searching for.$ I went out to eat chicken gizzards, and even lamb hearts with him?$ Hey!$ Blabbermouth!$ This is my bottle.$ I didn't pour that drink just so you can dump it into that cheap blabbermouth of yours.$ Hey, blabbermouth.$ Why aren't you saying anything?Why don't you try saying something?Huh?$ That cheap mouth of yours is useless unless it's used for gossiping, right?$ Hey.$ Hey!$ What... what did you just do with that cheap mouth of yours?$ Now that's the only kind of excuse my lips can make.$ Your excuse... was a little short.$ Then... should I give you a longer explanation?$ First of all... since you can't be the only sober one here, start drinking.$ Give us another bottle.$ It tastes so sweet.$ So sweet.$ I really like the rooftop of your place.$ I can now understand why you say that you feel most comfortable up there.$ It's a perfect place to have a beer.$ I want to fill up your fridge with beer... and I want to come over every day to have one.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ How many beers should I get to fill up your fridge?$ Should I buy one beer for tonight, or can I fill it up as much as I want?$ For now... just a single pack.$ Six beers?$ I want to have a beer too while holding your hand.$ If it's only six beers, we can either drink them all tonight or if there are still some left...$ then you can come back another time.$ Okay.$ One pack.$ Any specific kind you like?$ No, I'll figure that out on my own.$ We'll just start off with a pack.$ It would be too unfair to just leave without even doing that.$ One pack.$ Six days.$ I've bought myself that much time at least.$ Woo Jin.$ Gong Shil, please help my mom.$ No, I don't want to.$ I'm not going to look at you.$ Gong Shil.$ Please help me.$ I'm not going.$ Go away.I said, I'm not going!$ Where did she go?$ [ President Joo ]$ Why isn't she answering her phone?$ Miss.$ Aren't you going to answer your phone?$ I wasn't sure what was going to happen, so I put a tracking device in Gong Shil's bag.$ Found it.$ Driver, stop the car.$ Woo Jin.$ Mommy is coming to be with you.$ Ma'am!$ No, you can't!$ Please don't do this!$ Let go!$ Please don't do this.$ Don't do this!$ Please calm down.$ You can't do this.$ Woo Jin.Woo Jin!$ - You can't do this.$ It's too dangerous.$ - I want to go to him!$ It's okay.$ Woo Jin is standing next to her.$ He came to ask for my help because his mother was in danger.$ I almost got you killed the last time I followed that kid.$ But I ended up following him again.$ Even though I stopped her this time, she may try doing the same thing again.$ That's her life.$ How can you expect yourself to handle all that?$ I kept being swayed because I continue to see and hear them.$ Even though I really hate it, this is just who I am.$ I can't even handle myself.$ So, how can you be expected to handle me?$ If you go with that man... will you then be able to stop seeing the things that you don't want to see?$ I don't know.$ But don't you think that I should at least try to find out why I ended up this way?$ I'll accept your decision.$ Okay.$ This ends right here.$ Tae Gong Shil.$ You and I are nothing but two people who've only held hands once and shared one single meal together.$ It means that we'll easily forget one another.$ I'm going... to forget you.$ Okay.$ If you really hate me... you can curse me and call me a bitch who left you after bewitching you.$ No, thanks.$ There's no need to curse out a woman whom I've only held hands and dined with once.$ I'm leaving.$ Even to the very end... she hadn't said... that she loves me.$ It has now been three hundred... and seventy five days since the sun gone down in my life.$ But I haven't collapse and crumble.$ What should I wear today?$ - Is everything prepared?$ - Yes.$ Our sales and revenue must beat out Giant Mall in the annual sales report.$ We're preparing some special events for the end of the year sales drive.$ I'll be leaving for Shanghai after this season ends.$ We need a huge and definitive advantage over Giant Mall in sales before I leave.$ - How much?This much.$ - This much.$ Even bigger.This much!$ Once Joong Won leaves for Shanghai next year... you'll be taking over his position as the President of this location.$ The thought of that gives me the butterflies.$ I have to do whatever I can to make sure that he gets married before he leaves.$ He sees Ms. Park So Hyun with all the frequent meeting with Sejin Group, right?$ - What do you think of those two?$ - They only get into hot debates over money.$ I don't see any possibilities between those two.$ Why don't you try setting up a dinner or something after one of those meetings?$ You can do that, can't you?$ Well... yes, okay.$ But...From the way I see it... it seems to me that President Joo is waiting.$ Do you think that it makes any sense that Joong Won would wait around for anyone?$ As long as he wants, I can get a line of women for him from here to the moon.$ But...Bang Shil?$ What is she... a princess from outer space or something?$ - Why would he wait for her?$ - Well, you know...$ I'm waiting for the sun to rise again.$ As a show of your belief that the sun will rise again... can you bang the can, and spin the lid?$ Thanks.$ In its own way, it comforts me when you bang the can and spin the lid for me.$ Deputy Ahn.$ Did you tell him that his meeting with Sejin Group is at the Palace Hotel?$ Yes, Sejin Group called this morning to confirm as well.$ Oh no, what to do?$ I needed to coordinate with President Joo's schedule and set the meeting up at Kingdom but I seemed to have made a mistake.$ I have to go with him to that meeting.$ President Joo will probably get really upset if we change the schedule.$ I'll speak to him since I'm the one who made the mistake.$ How in the world did I make such a simple mistake like that?$ I wonder if I was bewitched by a ghost.$ We're here way too early for the meeting.$ There's no way that Chief Secretary Kim would've made a simple mistake like this.$ I wonder... if he's really sick?$ Chief Secretary Kim.$ Have you been to the hospital yet?$ You still have to consider your age even if it is just a cold.$ Take the next few days off and rest.$ You're going to get me sick with your cold.$ I'm going to send over the doctor, so just stay home and don't go anywhere.$ What about dinner?$ I'll send over some of your favorite tuna porridge.$ No, you can't have any ice cream.$ I'm hanging up.$ I noticed you when you first walked in.$ If it's okay with you, can I join you for a drink?$ No, I'm actually waiting for someone.$ You've been sitting here by yourself all night.$ - Well, yes... excuse me.$ - Yes?$ - Would it be okay if I moved my seat?$ - Yes, go ahead.$ Thank you.$ Thank you.$ This change is nice.$ Has Seoul's night skyline always been this pretty?$ Excuse me, Miss.$ Would you like to have a drink with me?$ No, thanks.$ Please go away.$ You look so much like someone I know.$ I said, forget it.$ You're really... not going to look at me?$ I'm here with someone.$ Who?$ A ghost?$ It is you, Tae Gong Shil.$ The bitch who left me after bewitching me.$ Subtitles by

meet with$ Raphael Baena, but instead I am talking with a homicide cop.We attend all cases of sudden death.$ Yeah, well the words sudden and death are not making me any less nervous.$ What were you expecting to discuss with Raphael Baena?$ I meet with him, take the temperature of the company, analyse any potential risk to us and the shareholders.Did you know him?$ No.$ Is this illness the cause of death?$ I can't answer that until we've had the pathologist's report.$ Just in case you need to get hold of me.$ May I have yours?Sure.$ I know.$ He doesn't like the heat.$ Eh, do you, Pavarotti?$ Ah, yes, my son, Simon.$ You won't remember me, but I used to come to parties at your father's house.Little Javier.$ Such a serious boy.$ Serious eyes.$ Your father used to say that when you looked at people, it was like you were weighing their soul.$ When we were kings.$ No.Not at all.$ Why do you think he wrote you that letter?That's what I wanted to ask him.$ I thought he might have some news of Simon.$ What was meant by hope and healing?$ Simon has problems.$ Drugs.$ He's been in and out of prison...$ Did Raphael Baena know this?Very little about my life has been private.$ It's embarrassing for Ignacio but he's never turned away from me.$ He pays for this place, gives me an allowance.He's always been there to pick up the pieces.$ And Simon?Your brother said he was lost to you both.$ I think he's here.Somewhere in Seville.$ He hates me.$ Why do you say that?His mother overdosed.$ I wasn't faithful, I wasn't..... discreet.And when she was gone,$ I couldn't bear to be in the same room as my own son.$ He looked so much like her.$ Ignacio and his wife raised him as their own.He loved them.$ I keep expecting the call to tell me he's dead.$ Listen to me, I might as well be in the confessional.$ Of course.$ This must be a shock.No, no I'm alright.No, I'm...$ I was just saying to the inspector here we knew him as a young boy, remember?$ No, I'm afraid I don't but...$ But then Pablo always had the good memory out of the two of us.$ What did it say?$ There's nothing unusual on Baena's mobile or landline - calls to his oncologist, between himself and Ignacio Ortega, a call to a restaurant Home and office computers?Office computer wasn't tampered with, but the home computer was wiped.$ Before it was wiped Baena copied a file from an email, a large file, probably onto a memory stick$ Who did the file come from?$ All I've got is the sender name - nine circles.$ A bit more time and we should be able to get the location of the sender from the IP address.$ What's on the file?There's no way of knowing.$ We need the memory stick for that.$ Someone who commits suicide knows what's going to happen.$ So does someone in the advanced stages of a terminal illness, they know they're going to die.$ So this, no matter what happens, he's writing about something else.$ I need to take this.$ I'm running a background check.$ I'll follow up on the restaurant.No, no, I'll do that.$ Always the same table - quiet, at the back, out of the way.$ He liked rich food that he couldn't eat.$ Not since he got so ill.I thought his illness was a closely guarded secret.$ Men tell me things they wouldn't tell anyone else.$ Most men tell me things.$ Did you put the phone down because you didn't want to talk or because you did?$ These past months..... it's not that I didn't want to...I just couldn't...$ Falcon, Falcon!$ Falcon!$ How did Baena die?Was it a glass of milk like your mother?$ I'm taking you off this.$ Ramirez will work to Calderon.$ Why?This tottering goat-fucker here is as much for you as they are Baena.$ We don't want your recent history raked over again...$ Everything's been said.$ They can rake up all they want, I've got work to do.$ Maybe you should think about your sister.$ Can she take these bastards door-stepping her again?$ Right.$ It's for the best.$ Javier?Called in by someone walking their dog.$ Expo site.$ Probably a dead tramp.$ ( RADIO) Simon Ortega apprehended.$ Bringing him into the station for questioning.$ Where's my shopping?$ It's got to go in the fridge.$ The meat.$ It's got to go in the fridge.$ It'll spoil.$ It's got to go in the fridge.$ Put his shopping in the fridge.$ Go on - do as he asks.$ I can't be here right now.$ Not right now.$ I've got stuff to do.$ Important stuff.$ If you can let me go, I swear, I swear on my life, I'll come back later.$ Alright, just give us a minute.$ What important stuff do you have to do, Simon?$ I don't even know what I've done!$ That's alright, it's alright.$ I just want to ask a few questions and the sooner you can answer them...$ Ask me, cos I have to get out of here.Did you know Raphael Baena?$ He left you a lot of money.$ Can I have a word with you outside for a moment?$ This isn't your case.$ It's mine.$ And I'm the one who'll be talking to him.OK?$ Then I'd like to be present when you do.It's not your case!$ And I won't be questioning him just yet because he's used.$ Wait until he's tearing chunks out of himself and he'll tell me whatever I want.$ Jose Luis, he had 1,700 Euros hidden in his shoes.$ He's probably dealing.$ Or somebody, maybe Raphael Baena, gave it to him.$ The notes are fresh, they're new - examine the evidence before you jump to conclusions.$ It's not your case, it's mine!$ Get back to your dead tramp.$ You can't keep me here.$ Tell me what I've done.$ I just want to see my son!$ Tell me what I've done, hmm?$ You can't keep me here!$ Tell me what I've done.$ Simon...$ Where have you been?$ Fuck off, Dad.Look.$ They said you had lots of money on you?Just fuck off.$ Fuck off, Dad!Get the fuck away from me!$ Look, I'm just trying to help...$ I'm only...$ Yeah he's alive at least.That's something.$ Yes.$ He's going to be here for a while.$ So if you'll come back...No, no, no.$ I'm not going anywhere.$ I'm going to wait for my son.$ If you need anything.$ Alicia.$ Hi.$ Poor bastard took some beating.$ What's this?It was inside his shirt.$ Your man wasn't itinerant, because in my experience, homeless people don't tend to have their clothes laundered.$ OK, contusion to right side of the face.$ There's an impression of knuckles, I'm saying left handed killer.$ Tongue removed at the root, whilst victim was still alive.ID?$ No finger prints, nothing.$ Dental - forget it.$ He wore a combination of dentures and crowns.$ Interesting fact - his teeth didn't fall out, they were pulled out.$ He's been tortured.$ Or he had a shit manicurist.$ How old are these scars?$ Not recent, between 30 and 40 years I'd put it?$ What did you find out on Raphael Baena?$ Have you been told not to talk with me, Alicia?It's not your case, Javier.$ Leave it at that.$ Alright.$ 12, 13 years old, if that.$ No name, no ID.$ She's number seven this year, unidentified kids murdered and dumped, that I've had to sign off on.And they're the ones that have been found.$ I pledged my whole life to putting a stop to this shit and now$ I can retire, safe in the knowledge that I've done absolutely fuck all.$ Remember all that time I spent in Marbella?$ Working a tip off on trafficking juveniles?$ I got the lead from a gang member right here in lovely Seville.$ He was found with his tongue cut out.The leads folded,$ I spent six weeks chasing ghosts.Left handed cut?$ Left handed cut.$ Not a trace of forensics on the body but I liked Guillermo Molina for it.$ The name's familiar.Oh, you name it, he runs it.$ Guns and drugs.$ Fascist and proud of it.$ An outstanding bag of shit.$ Thug for hire.$ You have a look at him.$ Can I help you?$ Nice neighbourhood.$ It is isn't it?$ It's clean.$ Peaceful.White.$ Got us to thank for that.$ Left to you lot, this place would be crawling with filth.$ You're left handed.That a crime now, is it?$ No, but it's distinctive.$ Shame about your nephew.Had the makings of a good torero.$ You know my ticket was 100 euro that day?$ Don't worry, wasn't completely wasted.$ I went to see a death...$ and I saw one.$ Can I help?$ Thank you for your attention.$ Now, I can confirm that Raphael Baena, CEO and founder of Baena Construction, has been found dead in his house.$ At this point in time we can't speculate as to the precise nature of his death, but there is no evidence of foul play and everything points to natural causes.Thank you.$ The names of every male guest who had their clothes laundered by housekeeping in the last two weeks.$ Virgilio Guzman.$ Nine circles.$ I'm sorry?$ Dante was led through the nine circles of hell by Virgil.$ I don't follow...You've a guest by the name of Virgilio Guzman.$ I'd like to see his room and a copy of his passport.$ He was Chilean.$ You'll be discreet, won't you, Inspector?$ You saw the press conference then?$ Was the file retrieved from Baena's hard drive?$ Apparently it's not a priority any more.$ And what did you get from the background check to his military training?$ Raphael Baena had no military training.Raphael Baena died in a hospital in Toledo from diabetes on the 31st August, 1984.$ Baena Constructions - the gold standard international company built from nothing.$ Get out, Javier!$ These scars on Baena's face, plastic surgery, yes?Just nod or shake your head Alicia, that way you're not talking to me.$ Recent?$ Ten years ago?$ 20?30?But the other body, those scars are older, yes?$ 40 years.They might be.$ His name was Virgilio Guzman.$ He was Chilean.There was a military coup in Chile 40 years ago.$ September 11, 1973.$ If you were involved in that, wouldn't you want to change your face?$ This isn't Raphael Baena.$ So who was he?$ Who told you not to talk to me, Alicia?$ How far up does this go?$ The bodies are connected!Raphael Baena and Virgilio Guzman were silenced by the same killer.$ But you knew that already, didn't you, Commissioner?$ Virgilio Guzman, nine circles.Baena was emailed from that address seconds before he died.$ Why?$ Who told you to lie?$ What did you just accuse me of?$ I'm accusing you of covering up a double homicide.$ What's Baena's real identity?$ Who are you protecting?Someone's pulling your strings.$ Who is it?$ OK.Perhaps we should...$ Is this what the Chief Commissioner gets to do?$ Bury a few bodies for his friends?$ I'm suspending you with immediate effect.$ You will be called to a disciplinary hearing.If I get my way, you will be handing out parking tickets at the arse end of nowhere for the rest of your fucking life!$ Yeah, fuck you.( TYRES SCREECH)Rafa?$ Who is it?$ Hi.$ Oh my god!$ You should go to the police.$ I am the police.$ You were the police.The judge came to my restaurant.$ I overheard him telling Ines.$ That's why I came.$ He was defending you.$ I'm not on trial.$ Oh, yes you are.You are your very own judge, jury and executioner.$ I'm going to tell you somethingI would have told you a long time ago if you'd let me.$ What?$ You are not to blame.$ Rafa, the lies your father told, your mother's death... it's not your fault.$ I've hurt my sister.I've taken everything from her.$ You just told the truth.$ Someone had to, after all these years.$ But Manuela is grieving and so are you.$ You'll have a scar.$ There are three people in my life I care about.$ Two are my sons.Take a wild guess who the other one is.$ My number.$ There are other lives besides the one you are trying so hard to lose.$ I think Raphael Baena's death is suspicious and so do you.$ It doesn't matter what I think, it's not my investigation.$ Javier, what are you doing here?$ I have to work.( GUNFIRE)Javier, I can't let you do this.$ Simon.$ It's the same killer.$ He's not working alone.$ You're talking about serious conspiracy here, corruption.$ You better be right about this.I'm certain of it.Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd$

5768797$ The astronomers are assembled in a large hall embellished with instruments.$ The president and members of the committee enter.$ Everybody takes his seat.$ Entrance of six man-servants carrying the telescopes of the astronomers.$ The president takes his chair and explains to the members his plan for a trip to the moon.$ The scheme is approved by many.But one member violently opposes same.$ After some argument, the president throws his papers and books at his head.$ Upon order being restored, the trip proposed by the president is voted by acclimation.$ The man-servants bring travelling suits.$ President Barbenfouillis selects five colleagues to accompany him:$ Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas and Parafaragamus.$ We enter the interior of the workshop where smiths, mechanics, weighers, carpenters, upholsterers, et cetera are working hard at the completion of the machine.$ Micromegas accidentally falls into a tub of nitric acid.$ A workman informs the astronomers that if they would ascend to the roof, they will witness a splendid spectacle:$ the casting of the gun.$ Against the horizon, the chimneys are seen belching forth volumes of smoke.$ Suddenly, the flag is hoisted.$ At the signal, a mass of molten steel is directed from each furnace into the mold for the gun.$ The mold pours forth flames and vapor.$ On the top of the roofs of the town, pompous preparations have been made.$ The shell is in position, ready to receive the travelers.$ These arrive respond to the acclamations of the crowd and finally enter the shell.$ A marine closes the bridge through which they have passed.$ A number of gunners are pushing the shell up an incline into the mouth of the gun.$ The cannon is loaded.$ The bridge is closed.Everyone is waiting for the signal which starts the shell on its voyage.$ An officer gives the signal.$ The gun is fired and the shell disappears into space.$ The shell coming closer every minute, the moon magnifies rapidly until finally it attains colossal dimensions.$ The shell comes down with a crash.$ The astronomers get out and are delighted at the landscape which is new to them.$ Against the horizon, the Earth is rising slowly into space illuminating the picture with a fantastic light.$ The astronomers see craters everywhere.$ Just as they are about to explore, an explosion throws the unfortunate men violently in all directions.$ The astronomers show signs of fatigue after the rough trip they have just had.$ They stretch themselves out on the ground and go to sleep.$ Seven gigantic stars representing the Great Bear appear slowly, and out of the stars come faces of women who seem annoyed at the presence of these intruders in the moon.$ Then, the stars are replaced by a lovely vision of Phoebes on the crescent, of Saturn in his globe and of charming young girls holding up a star.$ They decide to punish the terrestrials in an exemplary manner.$ By order of Phoebes, snow is falling from all quarters, covering the ground with its white coat.$ The cold becomes unbearable.So the unfortunate voyagers wake up half-frozen.$ They decide without hesitation and in spite of the danger to descend into the interior of the great crater in which they disappear one-by-one whilst the snowstorm is still raging.$ The astronomers arrive into the interior of a most curious grotto filled with enormous mushrooms of every kind.$ One of them opens his umbrella to compare its size with the mushroom, but the umbrella suddenly takes root and transforming itself into a mushroom starts growing attaining gigantic proportions.$ The astronomers suddenly notice strange beings coming out from underneath the mushrooms while making singular contortions.$ These are the Selenites, or inhabitants of the Moon.$ A fantastical being rushes on an astronomer who defends himself and with a stroke of his umbrella the Selenite bursts into a thousand pieces.$ But the Selenites are arriving in numbers.$ The astronomers are captured, bound and taken to the palace of the King of the Selenites.$ On a splendid throne, surrounded by living stars, the Selenite king is seated.$ President Barbenfouillis makes a dash for the King of the Selenites and lifting him like a feather throws him violently on the ground.$ The astronomers run away in the midst of the general disorder.The Selenite army is pursuing them.$ The astronomers run at full speed turning around each time they are pressed too closely and reducing the fragile beings to dust.$ At last, the astronomers have found the shell and quickly shut themselves in the interior.Thanks to the advance, they have succeeded in getting over their adversaries.$ Only one, the president, has been left behind.$ He rushes to the rope which hangs from the point of the shell and letting himself slide down the rope he gives it an impetus which causes the shell to fall off the edge of the moon.$ The sea appears.$ The shell balances and thanks to the hermetically sealed air in its interior rises slowly to the surface.$ The Mayor welcomes the astronomers with a speech, and the general ovation awaits their happy return.$

was gonna see somebody tonight.$ She came at me, and I must have grabbed her by the throat.All right.$ Take it easy.Take it easy.$ I didn't know what I was doing.$ I just saw her face looking up at me$ And she just fell.$ Calm down.Calm down.$ Mark, you gotta tell me what to do.$ All right.$ Now, was there anyone else in the house when this happened?$ Was the maid there?$ No, she, uh, she left about 8: 15, when I got home.$ Did you call anyone?$ Just your place.$ Margaret told me you were here.$ But you didn't say anything to her?No.$ Or maybe I should call Fred.$ He doesn't handle criminal cases, but he must know somebody...$ No.No.$ Or maybe I should go to the police.$ Mark, I didn't mean to kill her.$ Hugh, you can't afford to do that.$ Everyone knows the problems you and Janice were having.$ Now, listen to me.$ It's almost 10: 00.$ I want you to go in the other bar, there are more people in there.$ At exactly 10: 30, I want you to call your house.$ I'll answer the phone.$ You pretend it's Janice.$ Make sure the bartender and anyone else in the bar overhears your conversation.$ Why?$ You want me to help you, don't you?$ All right.$ Do as I say.$ All right, Mark.$ Fine.$ Janice, is that you?$ Are you in a bar?$ Yes, yes, that's right.$ Is everything all right?$ Everything's just fine.$ Now listen to me.$ She's gone to bed early, she's not going to wait up for you.$ Yes, yes, darling.$ Of course, you must be exhausted.$ Get a good night's sleep, and I'll see you in the morning.All right.$ Say it.$ All right, you get a good night's sleep, and I'll see you in the morning, huh?$ All right.$ Fine, Hugh.You're doing just fine.$ Now listen to me.$ You stay right there in the bar and don't move until the police contact you.Do you understand?$ Yes.Yes, dear.$ Yes.Perfectly.$ Yes, good night, darling.$ Ah, she's been out all day shopping.$ She's exhausted.$ Yes, sir.$ She's gettin' ready for bed now.$ I guess it won't hurt to have another one.$ ( Margaret) Mark, is that you?$ It's me.$ Hi.$ You're home early tonight, Mark.Yeah.$ [ Sighs ]I was a little tired.$ What's this?$ Another one of your bleeding-heart friends get into print?$ Did you win tonight, Mark, or is that a silly question?$ Oddly enough, I did.$ Wonderful.$ Yeah.That means I won't have to write you a check this week.That will be refreshing.$ [ Mark chuckling ]$ Won't it be?$ For both of us.$ Did I tell you I'm speaking at the Holcombe House tomorrow evening?$ They've named me" Woman of the Year."$ Really?$ How much is that going to cost you?$ Oh, don't be crude.$ My, my," Woman of the Year," that's quite an honor.$ Playing queen bee to a motley assortment of junkies, pushers, and losers.$ You know, I don't know how much money you've pumped into your assorted charities, Margaret, but it's a lot more than any $ 10 trophy they're going to hand you.$ Not tonight, please.$ Darling, if you're embarrassed by all your millions, why don't you just sign them over to me?[ Chuckles ]$ They wouldn't embarrass me in the least.$ Money is a weapon, Mark, a tool to be used for good, if it's used properly.$ Properly?I see.$ That means handing it out like Halloween candy to a bunch of grifters who've never done a day's work in their lives?$ 'Cause nobody has ever given them a chance.$ Come on, Margaret.$ Do you know what it's like to be an ex-convict trying to find honest work?$ Margaret, please.$ Please don't lecture me on ex-cons.$ I wrote that book.$ ( Mark) Margaret.$ ( Margaret) What is it?$ A man.I just saw a man running from the Caldwell house.$ What?$ Yeah.$ All the lights are on over there.$ I don't like the looks of that.$ I don't see anyone.$ Uh, do you think the man could have been Hugh?$ No, no, I left Hugh at the club.$ There's no answer.$ I think something's wrong.$ Police headquarters.$ Sgt. De Maio.$ Sergeant, this is Deputy Commissioner Halperin.$ Yes, sir.Yes, Commissioner.$ Uh, I just saw a man, a strange man, running from a house on, uh... on Fairfax Drive.$ I want you to dispatch a unit over there immediately.Will you?$ Uh, the number is 1278 Fairfax Drive.$ Right.$ I dropped my cigar.$ Is that it there, Lieutenant?$ Where?$ Under there.$ Wait a minute.$ I don't want to burn up the Commissioner's car.$ I got it.$ I grabbed the wrong end.$ Come here, you little rascal.$ Okay.$ That looks okay.$ Officer, do me a favor, huh?$ Look under there and make sure nothing's burning.$ ( officer) All right, Lieutenant.$ Uh, everything's okay, Lieutenant.$ You sure?$ Positive.$ Look again.$ Right, Lieutenant.$ ( Mark) What's missing?$ ( Duffy) Just her jewelry.$ He never went near the paintings nor the silverware.$ There's a vase out there worth a couple of thousand dollars.$ He never touched that.$ It's the same guy, all right.$ All right, I want you to pick up every known burglar in the morning.$ If you talked to them before, talk to them again.$ If you need any extra men, let me know.$ Yes, sir.$ Columbo, it's about time you showed up.$ Yes sir.$ I'm sorry.$ It was my car.$ The battery went dead.$ Commissioner, your car is here now.$ Thank you.$ Tried to get my wife's car.$ She was at my sister-in-law's, so I called there...$ It's a boring story.$ Thank you very much for sending your car.$ I appreciate it.$ It's quite all right.$ Duffy will fill you in on what's happened.$ It's the same man who's been hitting this area in the past few weeks.$ The M.O.' s identical.$ I see.$ Well, maybe I better look around.$ Good looking broad except for the marks around her neck.$ Certainly is.$ ( Columbo) What do you figure happened?$ Looks like she was getting ready to hit the sack.$ Probably heard the guy down here, came down to see what was goin' on.$ Could've just called us, but she's gotta make like a hero, right?$ How long has she been dead?$ Not too long.$ She talked to her husband on the phone about an hour ago.Yeah, an hour ago.$ Okay.$ It's all yours.$ Thank you.$ Find anything yet?$ ( Randall) Just a few smudges on this jewelry box.$ But everything else looks pretty clean.$ Sergeant, did you dust these handles yet?$ ( Randall) Not yet, Lieutenant.$ Well, let me know if you find anything.$ I think you're wasting your time, Lieutenant.$ This is the fourth timeI've been in this neighborhood in two weeks.$ Now this guy's good.$ Wears gloves.$ Never leaves me a print.$ Well, let me know if you find anything.$ Right away, sir.$ ( Mark) We will provide protection for all our citizens, not just those in the inner city or in the so-called problem areas.$ Now, the brutal murder, last night, of Janice Caldwell is a scathing indictment of the police department's failure, of our failure, to cope with crime on the most fundamental levels.$ The taxpayers of this great city are entitled to the safety of their own homes and I mean to guarantee that safety.$ ( bartender) What's the matter, Artie?$ Don't you believe in law and order?$ That guy gives me a pain.$ ( bartender) I'll turn it off.$ I thought we were going shopping.$ I told you I have to wait for somebody here.$ Well, he'd better hurry up because you're not spending any afternoon in this place.$ I hate this place.$ And you know I hate this place.$ But I like it.$ Did you get the tickets yet?$ What tickets?$ " What tickets?"

Columbo.$ Oh, isn't it perfectly awful?$ Janice Caldwell had so much to give.$ I'm sure she'd have found her way.$ Yes, ma'am.$ That's what I wanted to ask you about.$ You being close friends and all.$ Several people have told me that she and her husband were, um...$ Well, that is, that she...$ Well, they were having problems.$ Was she seeing other men?Is that what you wanted to know?$ Uh, yes, ma'am.$ Surely that can't make any difference now.$ Probably not, but I'd appreciate it if you could give me a few names.$ I'm sorry.$ I never pried into Janice's personal affairs.$ Once, last year, I, I did try talking to her.$ She became very defensive, almost violent.$ Then she was seeing other men?$ Yes.$ Young men, I believe.$ Men I didn't know.$ Thank you, ma'am.$ You've been very helpful.$ Uh, Mrs. Halperin, one other thing.$ Last night, the burglar...$ Your husband gave us a description.$ He saw him running from the Caldwell house.$ Yes, from our bedroom window.$ Now, I understand you were also in the bedroom.$ So, I would like to check your description with his.Oh, I...$ I didn't see him.$ By the time I got to the terrace, he had gone.$ You weren't at the window?No.$ Where were you?$ Well, I was in bed, and then I went to the window.$ Thank you, ma'am.$ Uh, one other thing, Mrs. Halperin.$ The Caldwell house?It's on the next block, is it?$ Yes.$ Right across the street.$ Number 1278.$ Yeah, I know the address.$ I was there this morning.$ I, I was just trying to visualize the proximity.$ Thank you.$ Excuse me, sir.$ A police officer to see you.$ The same one who was here this morning when you were out.$ Yes.$ Uh, would you ask him to come in, please?$ Excuse me, sir.$ I hate to trouble you at this time.$ Lt. Columbo.$ Yes, Lieutenant.$ My maid said you were here earlier.$ L...I'm sorry, I had to make arrangements...$ I hate to bother you like this.$ Like a cup of coffee, Lieutenant?No.$ ( Hugh) I'm afraid I've been drinking too much coffee today, but I didn't sleep very well last night.$ Thank you very much.$ Something wrong, Lieutenant?Wrong?$ No, sir.Not at all.$ Couple of things I want to clear up just to satisfy myself.$ Satisfy yourself, how?$ The way your wife died, Mr. Caldwell.$ Couple of small things.$ Probably don't mean anything.$ I spoke to your maid, Mrs. Um...$ Fernandez.$ She's a nice lady.$ I guess she worked very long hours yesterday.$ It must have been a big cleaning day.$ Well, I really wouldn't know.$ Apparently, your wife was out shopping all day.$ Mrs. Fernandez left here at, uh...$ Oh, it was after 8: 00, Lieutenant.$ And my wife and I arrived home about the same time.$ Your wife was downstairs?$ Right.In the living room, having a drink.$ Mrs. Fernandez says she was wearing a red dress.$ Yes, I believe it was.$ I see.$ And then you went out?9: 00.$ Yes.$ Was your wife still wearing the red dress?$ Yes, Lieutenant.$ Look, we had a couple of drinks.I left.$ Now, she didn't get ready for bed until I called her around 10: 30.$ At the club?$ They found you at the bar when the police finally located you.$ That's right, Lieutenant.$ Look, Janice apparently went upstairs to change.$ She put on her nightgown, heard a noise, came down, and surprised this burglar.$ I mean,I should think the facts would speak for themselves.$ It's very strange.$ See, there's one thing that's very strange.$ And what's that, Lieutenant?$ Mrs. Fernandez dusted the whole house.$ Wax, polish, everything.$ Including the bedroom.$ Now, the fingerprint people, they checked the handle on the closet door.$ Your wife's prints weren't on it.$ What I can't figure out is how did she open the door and take out the nightgown without leaving any prints?$ That's very simple, Lieutenant.$ You see, my wife was in the habit of folding her nightgown every morning when she got up and putting it under her pillow.$ Don't you see?$ She had no reason to go to the closet.$ Yes.Yes.$ I see.Yes.$ That would explain it.$ Yes, it certainly would.$ Well, thank you.$ No, not at all, Lieutenant.$ Excuse me, sir?Sir?$ Ma'am?$ Excuse me, ma'am!$ You got some jumpers for a battery?$ No.$ Listen, there's a gas station up ahead.$ Would you drive me over there?$ Thank you.$ Columbo?$ Excuse me, sir.$ I didn't mean to barge in.$ I looked for your secretary.$ I guess she's powdering her nose or something.$ May I, uh...$ I would've been here earlier, but my car broke down again.$ I had some more trouble.$ They're telling me it's the generator...$ If you don't mind, Lieutenant, I'm in something of a hurry.$ I'm making real progress.So, I thought...$ Finish your report?$ No, I haven't.$ Well, finish the report and I'll read it.$ Right now, I've gotta get home and get something to eat.$ I'm on that chopper patrol tonight.$ I understand, sir.$ Just take a minute.$ I know you're in a hurry.$ Before I actually fill out the report, if I could just double-check that description that you had...$ It was hardly a description.$ I barely got a glimpse of him.$ Right.$ You did say, uh, dark sweater.$ ( Mark) That's right.$ Dark pants.$ And some kind of cap.$ And a dark cap.$ Dark cap.$ That's it, then.$ Just dark?$ It was night, Lieutenant.$ And I was a long way away.$ Uh, that's too bad.$ That's what your wife said.$ You spoke to my wife, did you?$ I thought you left.$ What was that you said?$ I say, you spoke to my wife.$ Yes, there's nothing wrong?$ No.$ Certainly not.$ No, you know, you see, it was just that on the basis of the news conference this morning,I thought that she also saw the burglar.$ That's ridiculous.$ He was gone by the time she got to the terrace.$ Yes, sir.$ That's what she said.$ But you certainly gave that impression, so I thought...$ Look, Lieutenant, if you don't mind,$ I've got to go now, my limousine is waiting.$ There are a couple of other things...$ Give my secretary a call in the morning,$ I'll try to find some time for you.$ Oh, Mark, you frightened me.$ What are you doing home so early?$ Oh, I thought I'd get an early supper.$ Please leave the room, darling.$ You know I like to bathe in private.[ Chuckles ]$ Come on, Margaret.$ Don't be so coy.$ You know, you wear those bubbles like a suit of armor.$ Come on, Mark.$ I'll only be a minute.$ Have I told you recently, darling, that our marriage has been a constant joy to me?$ Have I?$ No, you haven't.$ Well, it has.$ I think the first thing that appealed to me about you, Margaret, was your... your generosity, that sweet open-handed quality of yours.$ Although sometimes your...your judgment's not so good.$ You know that, don't you?$ [ Laughing ] What are you saying?$ Well, $ 4.5 million and you're willing to hand it out to anybody who has a sad story and a rumpled suit.$ It's my money, Mark.$ My inheritance.$ Wrong, darling.$ My inheritance.$ Thanks for coming.$ Where's Margaret?$ She's at home.$ A closed casket, huh?$ Couldn't bear to look her in the face.$ Mark, I don't know how to thank you.$ If it hadn't been for you last night...$ You'd be facing a murder charge.$ If there's anything I can ever do for you...$ There is, my friend.$ Tonight.$ If you gentlemen want to finish paying your respects to the loved one, we will be closing up until 8: 30.$ I left Margaret at home.$ She's lying on the tile floor near the front door.$ She's dead.$ Good Lord, Mark.$ [ Whispering ] Quiet.$ How?$ She drowned in the bathtub.$ Only, the police are never gonna know that.$ They're gonna think the notorious Bel Air Burglar killed her.$ And you must see to that.$ What are you talking about?$ I can't get involved.$ You are involved, my friend.$ This is the quid pro quo.$ You killed your wife and I protected you.$ Now you protect me or I'll see to it that you go to jail for the rest of your life.Is that clear?$ Yes, perfectly.$ All right.$ Now, I left some clothes in a pile by the front door.$ Here's what I want you to do.$ This is Chopper One.This is Chopper One.$ Baker Seven, do you read me?$ Over.$ ( patrolman) This is Baker Seven.$ We see you, Chopper One.$ Okay, we're heading east.$ 10-4.$ A little early in the evening for this burglar, isn't it, Commissioner?$ You never know, Pete.$ Clocks don't mean a thing in an empty house, you know.$ Yeah, except last night the house wasn't empty.$ That's funny.$ What is it?$ That's my house down there.$ And I saw someone lurking near my wife's car.$ He' s disappeared.$ Circle around here, Pete, will you?$ Yes, sir.$ My God, Margaret.Hover over the pool.$ I'm gonna try to get out.$ Yes, sir.$ Help me!$ Quick!$ Please, for God's sake!$ What are you waiting for?$ Get an ambulance for God's sake.Margaret.$ My God, Margaret.$ She's gone, sir.$ What do you mean?$ You're crazy.$ She's gonna be all right.$ Get an ambulance!$ Lieutenant, I just heard.$ Terrible.$ The Commissioner, how's he holding up?$ They got him in the kitchen.$ They're putting some dry clothes on him now.$ It's not too bad, I tell you.$ The burglar, huh?$ It's funny, though.Very funny.$ What?$ There's no sign that he forced his way into the house.$ As near as we can figure it, he was laying for her, out in the back by the car.$ ( Randall) Lieutenant!$ Excuse me, Columbo.$ Lt. Duffy, sir.$ Yes, sir.$ ( Doyle) Just keep circling around.$ He's got to be around here somewhere.$ Yeah, well, keep looking.$ That's right.$ ( Columbo) What happened, Doc?$ See for yourself, Columbo.She drowned.$ In a pool?$ Guy tossed her in a pool?$ That's it.$ Wonder why she didn't swim?$ Probably couldn't swim.$ Well, maybe she passed out, Lieutenant.$ What are we gonna do?$ He didn't hit her first?$ No marks?$ No struggle?$ There might've been a struggle.$ She gotta tear on her sleeve.$ ( officer) Hey, Doyle?Yeah.$ Yeah.$ No, that happened this afternoon.$ She tore it on a cactus bush.$ I was there when it happened.$ ( officer) This guy just pulled up out front.$ ( Al) I've come to see Ms. Halperin.$ ( officer) What about?$ Well, she was supposed to come to our meeting tonight and get an award, that's all.$ The way things look around here,I'd like to get out of here.$ What did you say?$ A meeting?$ She was supposed to get an award?$ Yeah, Holcombe House.$ Gonna have dinner at 8: 00.$ And she was gonna make a little speech and pick up her trophy.$ I called her house when she didn't show.$ Line was always busy, so I came over.$ She was supposed to have dinner with you at 8: 00 and make a speech?$ That's where she was going when the guy jumped her.$ Where were you at 7: 30?$ I was at the place, setting' up.$ Relax, huh.$ You're making me nervous.$ You can prove it, right?$ Prove it?Yeah.$ I can prove it.$ I'll bet you can.$ All right, Doyle.$ Take this gentleman's name and let him go.$ Don't talk to me about manpower allocations!$ Now, this man killed my wife and I want him!$ Now, you get three units over here and get them over fast.$ You're gonna answer to me in the morning.$ Excuse me, Commissioner,$ I just want to tell you how badly I feel.$ And if there's anything that I can do...$ No, no, thank you.$ Mark, I want you to take those pills...$ What?$ I want you to take the pills that I gave you...$ All right, I'll take the pills.$ I'm shocked.$ Terribly shocking.$ The man is obviously insane.$ I mean, to come back here and do this...$ Particularly after the news broadcast when you told them about the increased patrols...$ Don't you see?$ It was the news broadcast that killed her.$ It was my fault.$ I don't follow, sir.$ You mentioned it this afternoon, that stupid slip of the tongue that I made when I said that Margaret and I were in our bedroom when the man ran from the Caldwell house.$ He must have thought she could identify him.$ That's the reason he came back.$ Not to steal anything but to silence her.$ Yes, that is a possibility.$ The tragedy is, she never saw him.$ She couldn't identify him.$ You mustn't blame yourself, sir.$ He threw her in the pool.$ She drowned before I could reach her.$ He threw her in the pool?$ Are you sure of that, sir?$ Of course, I'm sure of it.$ I was a witness.$ Pete Hayley and I were in the helicopter and we saw the whole thing.$ Then you had the light on?$ L...I thought I saw something.$ It was kind of a gut feeling, I suppose.$ I told him to go back and to hover over the patio area.$ I switched on the lights, and there he was.$ The same man holding Margaret in his arms.$ Are you sure it was the same man?$ Well, assumedly...$ Yes, he was wearing the same clothes.$ I see.$ You must have a lot of those.$ What?$ Gut feelings.$ What are you talking about?$ Well, you had a gut feeling last night.$ I don't know what you're talking about.$ What do you mean?When you asked for me to report to the Caldwell house.$ Yes.$ I found out you asked for me when you first called in.$ I did.What I mean, sir, is that the burglar had never harmed anybody before, yet from your bedroom window when you called in, you asked for me.$ I was just trying to figure out how you knew that the woman was already dead.$ I didn't.$ Didn't know, obviously.$ Well, I...I did have some kind of a feeling.$ I sensed something was wrong.$ Well, the lights were on, for one thing.$ The man running from the house, the fact that Janice was there alone, I...$ You're a policeman, I don't have to explain these things.$ Yes, I know exactly what you feel.$ I've had that feeling many times.$ You know something is wrong, you just can't get a handle on it.$ I'm going to look around the house if it's all right with you.$ Maybe the man got careless.$ Yeah, go ahead.$ What's the matter, Columbo?$ You think he's hiding in the tub there?$ ( Columbo) Just checkin'.Yeah?$ What did you find?$ ( Columbo) Clean and dry.$ Let me ask you somethin'.$ How do you figure this guy?$ I mean, to me, a burglar is like a hungry alley cat.$ He sneaks around after dark, but if he hears something', he runs.$ Haven't you ever heard of future shock?$ The world's going to hell with itself.$ Believe me, Columbo.$ Times have changed.$ Maybe.$ But still.$ But still, you know what bothers me about the murder last night?$ You mean the Caldwell woman?$ Yeah.$ I, uh, I looked at her body.$ Right away I saw on her finger the biggest diamond ring I ever saw in my life.$ Now, I gotta ask myself this question.What kind of a burglar robs a house and leaves a ring like that on the victim's finger?$ So that's what's been buggin' you?$ You're something else.$ Don't you think we thought of that?$ It's a phony.$ The ring was phony?$ Solid glass.$ A piece of garbage.$ A pro would have spotted it a mile away, and this guy's a pro.$ Excuse me, one moment, will you?$ Yeah, I guess that explains it.$ See, here I am,I've been batting my brains out trying to figure out about that ring and you guys had it all the time.$ Glass.$ How do you like that?$ Listen, Doc, do me a favor.Would you?$ When you perform the autopsy, would you check something for me?$ This woman apparently drowned in the swimming pool, so when you check her lungs, see if there's any evidence of chlorine.$ There won't be.$ Chorine dissipates almost immediately in the human body.$ Anyway, the fluids would be masked by the effects of pulmonary edema.$ So, uh, does that mean that you couldn't tell if this woman drowned, say, in a bathtub...$ Sure, if the bathtub were full of gin.$ Well, check it anyway, would you?$ It's part of the job.$ Yes?$ ( woman) Lt. Columbo, sir.$ All right, send him in.$ I hope I'm not disturbing you, sir.$ No, it's all right.$ Come in.$ This is none of my business.$ Stop me if I'm out of line, but nobody expected you to be at your desk today.$ I want to be here, Lieutenant.$ I want to keep working, keep my mind off...$ All right, let's see.$ Uh, here's, ahem, here's Lieutenant Duffy's report.$ There's no question, it's the Bel Air Burglar, all right.$ It's too bad he got away last night without a trace.$ Oh, and speaking of reports...$ That's what I wanted to talk to you about.$ I'm making terrific progress, but, you see, I don't think we should be looking for a burglar.$ What?$ No, sir.$ I think we should be looking for someone who made it seem like a burglary.$ What are you talking about, Columbo?$ Here, read Duffy's report.$ It shows very clearly it's the same man we've been looking for.$ I'm sure this is a very good report, sir, but there are a couple of things that don't add up.$ Like what?$ Oh, for one thing, the fingerprints.$ Come on, come on, Columbo, there were no fingerprints.$ That's what I mean, sir.$ You see, Mr. Caldwell left the house around 9: 00.$ He called his wife at 10: 30 from the bar at the club.$ This is what bothers me, sir.$ If Mrs. Caldwell spoke to her husband on the phone, why didn't she leave any fingerprints on the phone?$ Now that's strange, isn't it?$ The maid spent the whole day cleaning, she dusted everything.$ Including the phones.$ The phone in the upstairs bedroom, that's absolutely clean.$ The one downstairs has Mr. Caldwell's prints on it, but it doesn't have Mrs. Caldwell's prints.$ All right, what are you implying?$ That Caldwell never actually talked to his wife?$ Did it ever occur to you that maybe the burglar used the phone after she did and then wiped it clean?$ Occur to me that the burglar used the phone after and wiped it clean?$ No, sir.$ Why not?$ Well, because the burglar had to wear gloves.$ You see, sir,There were no prints of his anywhere in the house.$ Now there's another thing that's very strange.$ Is this bothering you?$ No.$ Excuse me.$ There's something else.$ The way this woman's body was dressed in that nightgown.$ She didn't do that.$ Somebody else dressed her in that nightgown.$ Is that a fact, Lieutenant?$ Or just some more of your fancy guesswork?$ Well, you see, sir, she was wearing a pale blue nightgown which she got from her closet.$ And you know something?$ There were no prints on the handle of the closet door either.$ I don't see what you're getting at.$ Unless you're trying to tell me that Caldwell killed his wife and then faked the whole thing?$ Oh, no, sir.No.$ I don't mean that at all.$ Mrs. Caldwell, she had a habit whereby she would put her nightgown under the pillow every morning.$ I saw a pink nightgown under the pillow.$ So, of course, we know that Mrs. Caldwell would not have put on the blue nightgown.$ Now, here's what's interesting.$ Mr. Caldwell, he knew about the nightgown under the pillow.$ So if he had dressed his wife's body, that would be the first place that he would have looked.$ No, sir, we're looking for somebody else.$ We're looking for somebody... somebody who tried to make a murder look like a burglary.$ Like who, for instance?$ I don't like to speak badly of the dead, but, yesterday, your wife confirmed to me that Mrs. Caldwell was seeing other men.$ And you think it was one of them?$ Yes, sir.$ I think that's a possibility.$ All right, now listen to me, Lieutenant, you're wasting your time and my time and the department's time and it's gonna stop.$ Now,$ look, Columbo, you must understand that no one, no one wants this man caught any more than I do.$ Especially now.$ But we are looking for a burglar, a man who killed one woman out of fear, who killed another to silence her.$ You go on that basis and we're going to solve this case.Is that clear?$ You don't think thatI have anything here?$ Lieutenant, nobody can be right all the time.$ Look for your burglar.There's the killer.$ Excuse me, uh,$ Mr. Wexler?$ He's inside with a customer for the moment.$ Oh, thank you.$ We can smoke here?Yes.$ May I help you, sir?$ No, thank you very much.$ No, I am waiting for Mr. Wexler.$ Mr. Wexler is servicing a client at the moment.$ If there's anything I can do...$ No, thank you.$ Oh, excuse me, ma'am.Do you happen to...$ Do you sell watchbands?$ Of course.$ I broke this a couple of weeks ago.$ I've been carrying it with me.$ This is a very good watch, only five years old.$ Waterproof and shockproof.$ Do you have something for that?$ Seven jewels.$ We have a large selection, sir, starting at $ 25.$ No, I don't want a watch, just the band.$ That is for just the band.$ No kidding.$ I think I'll do it some other time, thanks a lot.$ Oh, uh, Mr. Wexler is free now, if you'd care to see him.$ Thank you.$ Mr. Wexler?$ ( Wexler) I'm Bruno Wexler, yes.$ Lieutenant Columbo.$ If you can spare a moment, it's about Mrs. Caldwell.$ I believe she shopped here in your store.$ Mrs. Caldwell was a valued client, yes.Yes.$ That's what I understood, sir, from going through her papers.$ Mostly receipts for jewelry that she bought here.$ Of course, that was some time ago.$ The most recent receipt that I found was dated six months ago, September.$ Well, I would have to check back.$ Um, of course, she came in here quite a few times since then, didn't she?$ I mean, even though she didn't buy anything.$ I've talked to a few people, friends, the maid...$ Lieutenant, could you get to the point?$ May I sit down?$ Of course.$ This is the point, sir.$ Yes?$ It's glass.$ I can see that it's glass.$ But this appraisal for $ 8,000 for a 3.6- Carat, pear-shaped diamond ring with tapered baguettes in a four-prong setting.$ This appraisal is for that ring, isn't it?$ Well, I never would have charged Mrs. Caldwell $ 8,000 for a piece of glass.$ But that is your work, isn't it?$ Yes, Lieutenant.$ I arranged with a friend to have this copied for Mrs. Caldwell so that her husband wouldn't realize that she had sold the original back to me.$ As a matter of fact, she sold a lot of jewelry back to you.$ The woman needed money.$ Her husband had cut off her funds.$ Then all the jewelry in her house was phony.$ Almost all of it.Yes.$ Why did she need the money?$ Really, Lieutenant...$ I understood she had a lot of boyfriends.$ Well, Mrs. Caldwell was beautiful and charming for a woman of 36.$ But she fancied that she was growing old very slowly.$ In fact, hardly at all to judge by the young men from whom she found companionship.$ Yes, indeed.$ That's a real honey.$ You know, we don't get to see many of these around anymore.$ Especially in this condition.$ Well, I try to take good care of it.$ I'm looking for a Mr. Shoup.$ I'm Mr. Shoup.$ Charlie Shoup.$ My name is Columbo.$ How many miles you got on it, Mr. Columbo?$ 20,000?$ 30,000 tops.$ Oh, I got over 100,000 miles on this car.$ 100,000?$ That's pretty hard to believe.$ Well, look, I don't care what the speedometer says,I'm gonna make you an offer on a trade-in that you just won't be able to turn down.$ Police?$ Look, I just work here.$ The stuff they pull up in the business office is none of my doing.$ You got a beef?$ Go see the boss.$ Good-lookin' watch.$ Thanks.$ I'm here to talk about a Janice Caldwell.$ Did she give you that watch?$ Janice Caldwell was a friend of mine, Lieutenant.$ Where were you Tuesday evening, Mr. Shoup, between 9: 00 and midnight?$ That was the night Janice was killed?$ Tuesday evening.$ I was right here until 9: 30, that's when we close up.$ As a matter of fact, Janice was supposed to pick me up.$ When she didn't show up,I gave her a call at her place, but there was no answer.$ Figured I'd been stood up.So I...$ There was no answer?$ No, sir.$ What time?$ Around 9: 30.$ Go on.$ Well, like I said, I figured I'd been stood up.$ So I went out with a little bookkeeper we got here, had a couple of drinks across the street, went back to my place.$ You can substantiate that?$ She's right inside, Lieutenant.$ Ask for Shirley.$ That won't be necessary.$ Thank you very much.$ You've been very helpful.$ Lieutenant?$ I'll give you $ 80 for it in a trade.$ Excuse me, Commissioner.$ I'm sorry to bother you at home...It's all right.$ Come in, Lieutenant.$ Thank you, sir.$ I know I was supposed to have the report at 6: 00.$ Let me tell you what happened.$ My car let me down again.$ They let me use another one.$ Well?$ Well, what?$ Where is it, the report?$ That's the problem.$ I sat down in front of the typewriter and nothing happened.$ Absolutely nothing.Look, Columbo, I'm a little bit tired.$ If you've come in here to bombard me with more of your screwball ideas...$ May I explain the problem, sir?Just give me a moment.$ You've had a lot of experience.$ You happen to know this woman$ Mrs. Caldwell.She was your neighbor.$ I thought maybe you could help me out with this thing.$ I'm trying to figure it out.$ If you could just give me a moment.$ All right.Come on.$ Thank you, sir.$ You want a cognac?$ No, thank you very much, sir.$ I want to keep my head clear.$ This is complicated.$ See whether or not you can help me with this.$ Janice Caldwell died between 10: 30 and 11: 00.$ Sometime after her husband spoke to her at 10: 30 and sometime before you saw the burglar run out at 11: 00.$ Right?$ That's correct.$ That's why I can't start the report.$ Why?$ I get stuck in the beginning, the time of death.$ What are you talking about, Columbo?$ Janice Caldwell had a boyfriend.$ She was supposed to meet him at 9: 30.$ That's an hour before she was supposed to have died.$ She never showed up.$ So she stood him up.So what?$ Yeah, but the guy called her around 9: 30, too, and there was no answer on the telephone.$ I have to ask myself the question, why couldn't she answer the phone?$ You know what I wrote down?$ " Maybe she was dead already."$ You follow my thinking?$ Maybe she just didn't want to talk to the man.$ Did that occur to you?$ But she answered the phone later, when her husband called.$ You see the contradiction.$ If she didn't want to speak to her boyfriend at 9: 30, why did she pick up the phone at 10: 30?$ But did she pick up the phone at 10: 30?$ Because her fingerprints were not on the telephone.$ You see how confusing it gets.$ That's why I keep going back to this.$ " Maybe she was dead already."$ 'Cause if she's dead already, that explains everything.$ That explains why she doesn't pick up her boyfriend.$ That explains why she doesn't answer the phone.$ And it explains why her fingerprints aren't on the phone.$ Because if she was dead, her husband never spoke to her.$ It was a fake call.$ I specifically asked you this afternoon if you thought Caldwell had killed his wife.$ And you said no, for what I thought was a very good reason.$ Because he knew about the folded nightgown under the pillow.$ I did say that, sir.$ But in the light of these new developments, it occurred to me maybe he had an accomplice.$ Listen, why couldn't he go out and hire somebody to run out of the house at 11: 00, pretend to be a burglar.$ Provide him with an alibi.$ [ Snickering ] I see.$ I get it.$ The next thing, I suppose, that you're gonna ask me to believe is this phantom accomplice, who never killed anybody in the first place, of course, comes back the next night to kill my wife.Is that right?Is that the next step?$ You know, Columbo, I really...I really do admire your enthusiasm.$ The force could use a 100 like you.$ But this theory is a crock.$ ( Columbo) You think so, sir?$ We are looking for a murderer who was a burglar, who panicked and killed two women.$ Now, that's the theory we're gonna go on.$ Is that clear?$ That's an order.$ Yes, sir.$ All right.$ Tomorrow morning, I want you to report to Lt. Duffy in the Robbery Division.$ I want you to concentrate on his leads.$ A little legwork and we'll have this man in a week,I promise you.$ The burglar?$ Sir, in that connection,I, uh, I spoke to a Mr. Wexler today...$ Well, you're tired...$ Not important.$ Good night, sir.$ Good night.$ ( dispatcher) 194. 194.$ Come in, 194.$ This is 194.$ Lieutenant, we have a message for you from the Medical Examiner's office.$ Can you patch me through?$ Stand by.$ Go ahead.$ Doc, you wanted to talk to me?$ ( MacMurray) Columbo, I've got some bad news for you.$ I checked Mrs. Halperin's lungs for traces of chlorine.$ Just as I thought, no trace at all.$ Yeah?$ But I did find something that might interest you.$ Trihydric alcohol glycerol and palmitic acid.$ Say that again, Doc.$ Soap, Lieutenant.Soap.$ Find out what happened to Frankie Vale.Yes, sir.$ Tell that probation guyI want to see him by this afternoon.Yes, sir.$ I'm having some problems.$ Thought you would.$ I spoke to the Commissioner last night.$ He suggested that I report to you and maybe we could work together.$ Well, it's nice to hear you have a little faith in us.$ Come on inside, Columbo.$ I thought maybe you could give me a line on some of the guys that you spoke to.$ You know, the most likely suspects.$ Take your pick.$ But I'll tell you something, you won't find him in there.$ You sure?$ Columbo, these guys are like old friends.$ Very placid and predictable types.$ Now, what we're looking for is a younger guy, a guy with a violent temper.$ Let me ask you something.$ Leave out the last two murders.$ Just concentrate on the first three robberies.$ If you had your choice, which of these guys would you pick?$ That's easy.$ The guy on top.$ Artie Jessup.$ Artie's always my first choice when he's out on the streets, which isn't too often.$ Take a look for yourself.$ In and out of the joint since he was 20 years old.$ That's almost 30 years of state hospitality, give or take a few vacations on the outside.$ You know, I think old Artie prefers prison life.$ He's very nervous out here with us civilians.$ What about the M. O?$ Fits a lot of guys, including Artie.$ We've already talked to him.$ We can't hold him.$ Why not?$ Columbo, you said forget about the murders, right?$ Artie has an alibi for both nights.$ Mr. Jessup?$ Do I know you?$ I stopped by your place.$ Your wife told me you were here.$ My what?$ My wife.$ You got Scotch?$ Yes, sir.$ You like Scotch?$ She wishes.$ Give him some Scotch.$ Thought maybe you could help me.$ Suppose I wanted a few dollars for that.$ Where did you find it, in a box of Cracker Jacks?$ It's not real.$ Come on, pal, what is this, some kind of hustle?$ A cop.$ I must be getting old.$ I'm not from Robbery.$ I'm from Homicide.$ I'm investigating the killing of those two women in Bel Air.$ Oh, no.$ You're not going to hang that one on me.$ No way!No way!$ Where's my jacket?$ You wanna book me, go ahead, book me!$ Where's my jacket?$ You had nothin' to do with it.$ Then what are you here for?$ I had nothing to do with it.$ You wanna know what I am here for?Yeah.$ Sit down.$ I don't wanna sit down.$ May I sit down?$ Go ahead.$ You had nothing to do with it.$ Now, the guys down at the Robbery detail they can't identify the burglar that committed those two murders.$ That's what I'm here for.$ I can't help you.$ You haven't heard anything?$ Nothing.$ You're sure?$ Do you know I'm afraid of Siamese cats?$ One meow and I'm out of the door with my pockets empty.$ Oh, look, Lieutenant, that guy who killed those women, he scares me.$ I mean, he really scares me.$ Look, I'm a professional, we both know that, right?$ Otherwise you wouldn't be down here.$ That guy what killed those women, he gives guys like me a bad name.$ Right.$ Look, Lieutenant, if I knew who that guy was, you think I wouldn't have called you guys a long time ago?$ Right.$ Would you rob a thing like this?$ Are you kidding?$ They'd laugh me off the cellblock.$ All right, listen to me, Artie.$ I got a problem.You can help me.$ Me?$ I think I know who killed those two women.$ But I can't prove it.$ ( man) Hey, Artie, it's your old lady.$ She says, get your tail home, you're taking her shopping'.$ Tell that bag to go...$ Tell her I'll be home in a little while.$ You know who killed those women?$ Come on, Hugh, make sense.$ Who wants money?$ The man.The burglar.$ The one who's been robbing all the houses around here.$ That's ridiculous.$ Mark, he's dead serious.$ He's ready to go to the police if I don't pay him.$ But how does he know you killed Janice?( Hugh) I don't know.$ I don't know.$ The point is that he knows.$ I should've called the police the moment it happened.$ You did call the police, my friend.$ How much does he want?I don't know.$ I don't know.$ Said he'd tell me later today.$ When are you supposed to meet him?$ Uh, 4: 30.$ A bar at Fifth and Wall.$ All right, meet him.$ I'll be waiting nearby.$ Find out what he wants, and we'll decide how to... how to deal with him.$ All right, no violence.$ Why, Hugh,I'm no more violent than you are.$ The cops are trying to pin those robberies on me.$ But, you see, I didn't pull that job in your joint.$ But I figure you know that already, don't you?$ I don't know what you're talking about.$ Don't hand me that.$ I figure you killed your old lady and tried to pin it on me.$ Well, I got news for you, pal, nobody makes Artie Jessup a patsy, you got it?$ It's gonna cost you.$ You still haven't given me proof.$ I don't need any proof.$ All I gotta do is go to cops and confess to those first three robberies and, you know what, all of a sudden, they look into the other two where the women were killed.$ Now, what do you think?$ I think they got you.$ Hey, I don't mind one way or the other.$ Bein' on the outside isn't all that great.$ All my buddies are back there, so going back on a burglary rap,I won't mind that a bit.$ Now, come on.$ What's it going to be, pal?$ Do I go to the cops, or do we work something out?$ All right.$ How much?$ Good.$ Well?$ He wants $ 5,000 in small bills.$ Old money.$ Nothing larger than a $ 50.$ $ 5,000, is that all?$ The man has no imagination.$ When do you meet him?$ Tomorrow afternoon, here.$ Same time?$ Right.$ Now, Mark, he's dead serious.$ He says he knows your department has him under suspicion for those other robberies, but that they can't prove anything.$ He's not a stupid man.$ All right, now, I want you to get the money from the bank.$ I want you to be here tomorrow at the same time.$ Mark, we can't start paying him.$ He's just gonna want more.$ Just leave him to me.$ You keep your mouth shut and don't admit to anything.$ We're gonna be just fine.$ Both of us.$ Oh, Columbo.$ What are you doing here?$ Oh, good morning, sir.$ Good morning.$ Lt. Duffy is out on call.$ I'm using his office.$ What's the matter with your office?$ Well, I was going through these file folders.$ These are the prime suspects in the robberies and Duffy didn't want the folders out of his office.$ I wanna tell you something.$ I'm doing it just exactly the way you suggested.$ I'm concentrating my efforts on the robbery aspects of this crime, and you're right.$ I think the answer lies right in here somewhere.$ Good.$ Okay, well, maybe I'll take a glance at these myself again.$ I didn't get a very good look at that man the night he ran from the Caldwell house.$ Still you never know, do you?$ That's a good thought.$ Sometimes something just clicks into place.$ Well, on the other hand,I've been through these a dozen times.$ I don't think they can help me any.$ That's a good thought, too, sir.$ No sense wasting your time on a dead end.$ ( Mark) You keep at it, though, huh?$ If you come up with anything, let me know.$ Do you mind?$ Be my guest.$ Easy.Easy.$ Under the table.$ Gonna count it?$ I trust you.$ If it's short, you can always make it up in the next payment.$ The next payment?$ You said...$ I said a lot of things, Mr. Caldwell.$ One thing I forgot to tell you was that...I'm a chronic liar.$ ( Duffy) Sure they're in there, sir?Positive.$ Caldwell is meeting him on my instructions.$ Catch this man Jessup with the money, we'll have our killer.$ ( Duffy) Okay?$ ( policeman) Okay.$ All right.Move.$ ( Artie) Take it easy.$ ( officer) You want it the hard way?$ ( Artie) Take it easy!$ What are you trying to do, break my head?$ What is this?$ ( Mark) It's called blackmail, Jessup.$ First you rob this man's house, you kill two women, then you've got the gall to try blackmail.Get out!$ You don't have any proof.$ We'll have it.$ As soon as we search your apartment.$ Which we'll do right now.$ Columbo, Duffy, come with me.$ We'll need one squad car.$ Commissioner, we need a warrant before we can search that apartment.$ We already got one.You want to check it?$ Yes, sir, that's fine.$ I think you're making a mistake.$ I'll prove to you, I'm not.$ All right, take this man down and book him.$ Mr. Caldwell will give you his statement.$ Let's go.$ Commissioner, I believe you are making a mistake here, sir.Sir.$ I don't believe Jessup killed either of these women, particularly your wife.$ ( Mark) Don't be ridiculous.$ I saw it, he threw her in the pool.$ There were other witnesses.$ ( Duffy) Could you bring the keys up, please?$ Right away, huh?$ Sir.$ ( Duffy) He's on his way up, Commissioner.$ Thank you.$ Sir, I realize that your wife appeared to die in the pool.$ Actually she died in the bathtub.$ What are you talking about?$ Right this way, please.Right this way.$ Room 13.$ It was the water in her lungs.$ The water in her lungs.There were traces of soap.$ Duffy, check that bathroom.$ You, get the kitchen.$ You see, sir, as soon as I saw the body,I knew right away something was wrong.$ You did, huh?$ Check behind that stove, get under the sink there.$ I knew something was wrong because of her outfit.$ What she was wearing, the tear in her dress.$ You see, I had asked myself the question.Why does a woman go to an important testimonial dinner knowing that her sleeve is torn?$ Got a whole closet full of nice clothes.$ The one thing that I knew, she was not on her way to the dinner when she was drowned.$ So, now it follows, she must have been drowned earlier.$ Now I find out about the soap.$ That places it in the bathtub.$ You see, a couple of hours before her body was dropped into the pool, somebody drowned her and somebody dressed her.$ The Medical Examiner's report set the time of death at 7: 30, Columbo.$ Yes, sir.$ But that was based on your eyewitness testimony.$ Now, I spoke to him.$ He said it could just as easily have happened a couple of hours earlier.$ All right.Suppose she did die in the bathtub.$ Jessup surprised and killed her.$ He dressed the body and threw it in the pool to make it look accidental.$ No, sir, that's not possible.$ You know why?$ You see, the bathroom, the bathtub, the faucet itself, everything was bone dry.$ Including the towels, not even slightly moist.$ That was the first thing I checked, sir.$ Now, she had to have drowned before 6: 00 maybe even before 5: 00, otherwise it wouldn't have been that dry.$ Long before Jessup got there.$ As a matter of fact, just about the time that you came home for supper.$ I believe you killed your wife.$ And I believe you either killed Janice Caldwell or you're covering up for it.$ You just lost your badge, my friend.$ Come on, come on, keep digging.$ ( Duffy) Yes, sir.$ At first, I thought Mr. Caldwell was responsible, but that didn't work out because of the nightgown business.$ And then the next night when your wife was killed, and you had that terrific alibi, it suddenly hit me.$ You were in it together and you tried to blame Artie Jessup.$ And the truth is that Jessup was nowhere near either house either night.$ He wasn't, huh?$ All right, how do you explain these?$ Janice Caldwell's jewels.$ I can explain it.$ You took them from the Caldwell house, you hid' em, and today you planted' em here to incriminate Mr. Jessup.$ You're crazy, you can't prove anything like that.$ Sgt. Randall?$ ( Randall) Here, sir.$ You.$ Commissioner Halperin says he found these jewels under your mattress.[ Snickers ]$ That's crazy.$ You're a liar.$ Hey, I don't even live here.$ What?$ I can verify that, sir.$ He doesn't live here.$ I live here.$ These are my shirts.That's my underwear.$ My brother-in-law.$ That's my nephew, my niece.$ I haven't lived here long.$ Just moved in.$ You see, the apartment was vacant for three weeks.$ I just signed the lease.$ You looked in the closet.$ Those were my pajamas and my bathrobe.$ The file folder, the... the report on the desk.$ Yes, sir, I'll have to take responsibility for that.$ You see, I persuaded Mr. Jessup to telephone Mr. Caldwell, knowing that Caldwell would contact you.$ I was sure that once you knew the true identity of the burglar, you'd try and incriminate him.$ So this morning, very early, just after I signed the lease,I made up a new file folder on Mr. Jessup.$ Everything was the same except this address.$ Only one person, beside myself, knew this address.$ That was you, sir.$ That's all.$ I think once your friend, Mr. Caldwell, understands the situation, he'll fill in some missing pieces.$

5285786$ LSD is one of the strangest and most controversial substances known to science.$ A dose smaller than a grain of salt precipitates a hazardous mental journey into a universe of hallucination, intense emotion and, some believe, mystical revelation.$ These remarkable effects were discovered by the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman in 1943.$ During the 50's the LSD was used widely for research in psychiatric hospitals.$ Than in the early 1960's LSD leaked out of the laboratory.$ With bizarre and unforeseen consequences the drug was consumed by a generation of young people seeking spiritual transcendence and an escape from the conventional world.$ Introducing the American way of life on the threshold of the golden 60's:$ color, style, comfort, utility and convenience.$ Recreation, fun – these are the ultimate desires of today, tomorrow and the years ahead of these$ Post-war economic growth and material prosperity in the West did not satisfy the desires of everybody.$ Many young people lacking secure belief but living secure lives felt a spiritual dimension was lacking.$ For them this bus came to symbolize psychedelic liberation.$ LSD was a ticket to ride.$ I believe with the advent of acid we discovered a new way to think.$ And it had to do with piecing together new thoughts in your mind that produced people like Bob Dylan and John Lennon and William S. Barrows.$ They were using new images together in a way that jarred the mind and produced images that were latent in our consciousness but were not being brought about by reading Vanity Fair or Woman's Home Companion$ Author and" grand prankster" Ken Kesey was a leading voice in the 60's chorus extolling the virtues of LSD.$ With money from his first novel" One flew over the cuckoos nest"Kesey and his friends bought a second-hand school-bus painted it bright colors and loaded with LSD set off across America.$ On a journey across the continent Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters sensed a nation on the edge of a revolution.$ To Kesey the strange discordant effects of LSD seemed perfectly in tune with a times.$ I think that something happened in the early 60's that LSD was related to, music was related to.$ There was new movement in cinema and in stage.$ And maybe... that once a century something goes off like a century flower.$ LSD was just perhaps the pollenin that fell off of it but it didn't make it happen it was part of it.$ If the value of the LSD is that it expresses the... and brings?what was going on in a 60's than I think that's very strong argument against LSD.$ Because what was going on in a 60's is precisely something that I think we now have to recover from.$ At a time when many of his fellow students were embracing the psychedelic ideologyRoger Scruton, today professor of philosophy in a college, viewed it all with deep suspicion.$ Very difficult to summarize the 60's world, you will...$ I think one could say very briefly?that it was the attempt to have rights without duties, claims without responsibilities and pleasure without cost.$ And the real cost of having any peaceful enjoyment of the world is that one maintains institutions from makes a sacrifice in order to preserve one's inheritance.$ This was something that I think the people of the 60's, the young people of the 60's were very reluctant to do.$ And LSD ministered to that reluctance, it told them that even the most sublime experiences those of religion much people have thought in the past came through considerable sacrifice and worship and surrender.$ That experience too could be had on the cheap.$ Millbrook, NY.$ Here in 1963 was established a group who saw LSD as a sacrament of a new religion to change the world.$ They were lead by Timothy Leary, the former Harvard psychology professor, fired for giving LSD to his students.$ Our aim, like the aims of any religious group, just beginning, is to transform American society.$ I'm sure many of you viewers know,$ America today is an insane asylum.The american people are completely hung up on material acquisition, on power, on war making, its an insane asylum over here.$ And it's our goal to lift the spiritual level of the American people.$ We gonna try to bring about a religious renaissance and a spiritual revolution.$ Leary's East-Coast Millbrook community had a reverential attitude to LSD that contrasted sharply with the merry pranksters' anarchic West-Coast style.$ One day the two groups met.$ We came through riotous and noisy, they are a more sedate group, but there was no friction, between us in fact.I think they even gave us piece of, Baba Ramdas famous suit did you ever heard of that story?$ He was bringing across a pint of LSD in a suitcase, and it got broken in the airport, and suit soaked it up, so they chopped the suit, and put it in a deep freeze, and for some yearswhenever they wanted to get high they would cut off a little piece of the suit to eat.$ The only legitimate source of LSD was a Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz$ In 1963 Leary wrote to the firm, placing an order for a hundred grams of the drug.$ Enough doses for 2 million people.$ The letter was addressed to Albert Hoffman who'd stumble upon the strange effect of LSD in 1943$ Already alarmed by non-medical abuse of his discoveryHoffman advised Sandoz against supplying Leary.$ I became aware that LSD put became a problem from France and to US.$ And they wrote me that it had been used on the street and that had already made lot of propaganda for use outside of the medical profession.$ And I immediately realized that it could be dangerous because the substance which has such deep effect must be used carefully.$ You're introduced to LSD...$ Unless you've taken some other drug, like for instance like marijuana or something well you know it's an altogether new thing!$ and you actually can have, um, a religious experience, and it can be even more important than reading the bible six times, or becoming pope or something like that, you know$ At Millbrook children as young as nine were given LSD.$ The drug was freely available and everyone joined in its ritualized consumption.$ LSD was not illegal.$ Leary denied there were dangers and began of propaganda offensive.$ The kids who take LSD aren't gonna fight your wars... middle class, middle age, whiskey drinking generals.$ They not going to join your corporations... middle class, middle age, whiskey drinking corporation presidents.$ Enormous crowds come out to hear me lecture.$ Whenever I go to a college I always sold out.$ It's not because I'm that clever it because they gave me the good lines in the show turn on, tune in, drop out.$ Such an uncompromisingly antisocial attitude was not always characteristic of those interested in the spiritual potential of LSD.$ In the early 60's a group of psychologists and theologians in Boston conducted a remarkable and serious-minded investigation into the religious implications of psychedelic drugs.$ Hidden in the library of the Harvard Divinity School and kept for 2 decades under lock and key here is a doctoral thesis describing a research project unthinkable today: an experiment to discover the effect of psychedelic drugs on the religious experience of student priests.$ The project was the brain child of the late Walter Pahnke, a Harvard theological scholar also qualified as a medical doctor.$ The experiment took place in the Marsh Chapel of Boston University on Good Friday 1962.$ Today two of the participants return there for the first time.$ I must have been sitting down here.$ It was a kind of throne$ Randal Laakko was one of twenty students studying for holy orders who volunteered.$ Well we gathered that morning all probably an hour before actual service began upstairs.$ And we were in groups of four...there were five groups of four twenty people who were subjects.$ And we were all handed an envelope that we were asked to open and to consume the capsule that was inside.$ Of course none of us knew who had the drug and who had the placebo.$ And I don't know how many minutes transpired before we all began,I believe, feeling a reaction the placebo in fact was a form of stimulant that would create a sensation.$ I think at that point I was very much aware that something very unusual is beginning to happen to me.$ A sound recording was made of the service which by good fortune still exists today.$ He came to me with his eyes and asked for water.$ But his eyes were ageless and deep as well-shafts.$ They unroofed my brain with their profound grazing.$ Robert Kirven also received the psychedelic drug.$ For him the experience was initially unpleasant.$ - I tried hard to concentrate and remember were I was.$ Because?that.At the moment I couldn't picture my family or what I did outside this place.$ And then as I concentrated it occurred to me that this was supposed to be an experiment.$ I remembered that it was to be an experiment and / in mind expansion.$ Then I kind of went back and thought ok lets see what expands.$ And he said:Go about the world.$ Tell every one that you meet Man on The Cross.$ Tell everybody...$ There was a poem which I can't recall in detail but it had to do with hearing a cry and finding a man on a cross and not being able to help him down.$ But receiving instructions to going to all the world and tell everyone you meet:$ there is a man on a cross.$ And I felt that I had to get out of there and go find somebody and tell him:$ there is a man on a cross.$ But there were people in appeal and I felt I couldn't get out and that's whenI felt a failure as though I wasn't doing what I had to do$ To determine if the volunteers' experiences were spiritually valid, Walter Pahnke submitted their written accounts to a panel of theologians.$ The experts score the report for authenticity and after careful statistical analysis Panky concluded that the drug had induced mystical states indistinguishable from traditional religious visions.$ Many of the participants themselves agreed, but could they be certain their experiences were genuine?$ I don't know if I can be sure, other than to know that it something that happened to me.$ And, I realize that's a very subjective appraisal of that, butI don't know what else I can go with.$ I know that was deeply meaningful and moving to my life.$ Impressive the psychedelic drugs may seem to individual there are nonetheless many reasons for questioning the experience.$ Whatever the actual intensity of the experience, to call it religious is not... has nothing to do with how intense it is...$ is to interpret it?a meaning.And when you administer to yourself a drug which you know is affecting you by giving... producing a chemical transformation in the brain.$ It's strait difficult sincerely to interpret this is a visitation of the divine spirit or is a revelation of a transcendental world.It simply is an act of self deception to put that kind of religious interpretation on out of thought.$ But as the 60's progressed mind expansion became a craze.$ In Switzerland the directors of Sandoz began to hear of the wide spread and uncontrolled abuse of their product.$ Aurelia Chialetty was responsible for the production and distribution of LSD.$ Like kind of an explosion.LSD suddenly was on the street and was manufactured by a lot of people.$ Because immediately when it had high market value.$ I remember my first experience in NY in Greenwich Village where I was handed over, aaa, so called cube – a sugar cube with a few drops of an LSD solution on it.$ It was handled for 5 – 6 dollars a piece, late perhaps for 10 dollars.$ Well that was a value that 1 gram of LSD suddenly had a value of few hundred thousand of of dollars.$ And this element which changed dramatically the whole situation was for the firm the moment to say:$ now we have to stop it.$ Sandoz withdrew the LSD from sale but it was already too late.$ Black-market suppliers of the drug were everywhere including Britain.$ If you haven't heard of LSD – you will.$ It's a safe bet that this drug will make headlines in this country as it has for some years in America.$ – How do you mean, perception?$ – Well you had it drunk.$ – Has it done anything to you yet?$ – Oh, yeas, yes, yes, it's affecting me$ – In what way?$ – Colors have become quite a lot brighter.$ effect in the sky.– What do you mean by that?$ – Hm, well?$ ...Excuse me.... pink....$ The young of the educated middle classes particularly were attracted by the instant liberation LSD seemed to offer.$ Among them – Rosy Boycott, co-founder of the feminist magazine" Spare Rib".$ Incredible looking back to think how people... just took it like candy.$ And in fact we were told it was candy, it had names that were like candy.$ You know – sunshine and yellow, orange and everything that sounded like children's sweets.$ And you tended to do it a bit I mean it became... lots of people who would say do it every Saturday night – it became part of their life.$ They might go to a job in the city during the rest of the week in?$ which may call very normal, what we would call then a strait way of life.And at weekend they would metaphorically let the head on.$ – Now, is so far are these visual things the only effects you find?$ – No– What are the other effects?$ It's... it's...It's round...It's was shape...$ Everything is colored, everything, you know is,Ah it must be to do an orange...$ Not only orange...Oh...I haven't seen color.$ I live in a monochromatic world...$ I can't use color...I can do everything...$ The romantic view of psychedelic drugs as the road to personal and social liberation was not shared by all.$ Politically inclined members of the counter-culture soon discovered contradictions.$ Certainly in my case the whole idea of having anything to do with the drug culture ran up against a very big brick wall was when I started to get involved in feminism... and, as I say, it didn't work at all.$ The LSD was for the thinkers and it wasn't for the doers.$ And it was a real unreality in the drug culture, which was logically made up by the fact that it was totally easy to get buy with very little money.$ That you could be sort of hovering on the edge of a quite a twilight world in that you went up against any such a breach of commas...$ Any money definitely no never paying taxes or bothering by any things like that which were The Real World.$ That was the real strait world which you wanted to overthrow.$ And yet of course you were living on it.$ And that was the ultimate irony that it was that world.$ And that huge consumer boom that we were all experiencing in America and in England.$ That we're supporting that dream, say, lived in a place where you thought$ " I'm really changing the world" but in fact you were escaping it.$ LSD is a.... far worse even than err.. heroine, I think because of its action on certain people again.$ And now we've had experience where people who have taken LSD have gone in through plate-glass windows.$ We have people who were inside, with LSD coming out through plate-glass windows.$ So I don't know what direction these people are moving in.$ By 1967 a strong public reaction against LSD had set in.$ The medias and the government were busy pointing out the dangers.$ Any stress in this rising face will trip this man into a bad trip.$ He will have the same effect as the man who was given a material and doesn't know he's getting it.$ He will be terrified.$ He's not seeing pretty visions he's seeing monsters he's loosing his mind and he feels it going.$ He is intensely, extremely, terribly uncomfortable.$ If he is alone, if it's possible for him, there's only one escape from this discomfort a suicide... this man will kill himself.$ Exaduration was commonplace as public debates about the dangers and value of LSD intensified.$ Scores of books and hundreds of scientific articles appeared.$ And for a while psychedelic drugs became a" cause celebre"$ At the center of the storm was a distinguished psychiatrist Sidney CohenOne of the US government's chief advisors on psychedelic drugs.$ Well, LSD can do many adverse things the they are done almost never under control in supervised conditions, they happen when people take it casually and randomly.$ And when this happens this is news.$ And news is what has given LSD its current reputation$ Particular concern was caused by a widely publicized but subsequently descredited report that LSD might damage chromosomes.$ celidimite Other dangers however were real enough 20 years on we may be able to assess the true risks of LSD.$ A coordinator of the government funded" Standing Commitee On Drug Abuse"is David Terner.$ There's no no doubt that there are exadurations about LSD.$ But there are very real risks which are increased when you got a" LYSID" manufacture.$ The risks are around people having bad trips that's they experience very unpleasant and very intense feelings.$ That they have accidents because they believe they can do things which they really can't do.$ The happening cases people trying to fly out of windows$ The happening instances of people thinking they could cross the road or cross a railway track because they didn't believe that what was coming towards them was a car or a train and in those circumstances that's people risk damaging themselves$ and damaging other people.There are also risks for some people because use of LSD can actually precipitate a mental breakdown wich otherwise would not?$ And finally when you take LSD it is a drug more than any other that I know which is dependent upon your own expectations of it and the setting that you're in when you take it$ By 1968th a million of americans were estimated to have tried LSD.$ Many found its mental effects overwhelming.$ The Bad Trip – an unpredictable unpleasant reaction to LSD is a horrifying vortex of panic and fear that can cause long term psychological damage$ 1 in 4 who tried LSD without supervision encountered its darker side.$ Ronald Baldoon, an actor, was one of them.$ Attracted by descriptions of visual distortion and mystical revelation he took a large dose of LSD with a friend initially the experience was as advertised...$ It was a beautiful day, one of those rare days we happen to be in?of all places which, if anybody knows, is full of ammonites and ancient fossils.$ now became a life which it hadn't been for millions of years and you could look at any perspective of anything.$ You could do closeup or you could look wide-angled.$ And sure now you would see something different you haven't seen before - a new green, a new blue, a new sun light, a new shape, it was all there and were possible$ But then things went wrong.$ A normally manageable event assumed terrifying proportions under the influence of the drug.$ We went back to our campsite and we were greeted by this irate woman whose farm it was who we somehow camped wrongly in her field and it turned out the customs.$ And she called me and then she started to shout at me and press me down.$ I tried to be apologetic perhaps I've been even silly but she hated me her eyes pass through me, she thought I was a slob, she thought, possibly, that I was the real worst type of punk asthat could ever come down from London and camp in her feild.$ She hated me and it really affected me bad.$ And I went back to where our camp was and we tried to cook some bacon on our completely used-up calogas$ And there to my horror were ten or twelve slices of dead pig.$ I've never seen it like this before but there it was sliced up dead?$ pigAnd I was horrified and shocked and And we got in a car and we tried back to London$ And all the way back I was hunted by green monsters celtic monsters, cartoon kind of monsters not real monsters.$ Who were in my head but out of control and laughing at me pointing their faces at me and going haaa-haaa-haaa-haaaa we've got you.$ It put me off forever.$ I had this negative horrible feeling that behind everything there was something horrible...$ I didn't want that experience ever again.$ As the 60s were on, more and more reports of people damaged by LSD reached Albert Hofmann in Switzerland.$ The substance that he once hoped might unlock the secrets of the mind had become a monster.$ I did not feel me guilty because it is not LSD which is... bad it's just its use its misuse and the wrong use which is bad and which caused all these problems.$ And therefore people, many people told me -" Are you not feel errr... feeling guilty about whole story which you have... created here?$ And I said no, it's really not... and this must theee...in the ray... right way use the proper the LSD not dangerous compound...$ It is very very dangerous if used uncautiously and without respecting its very very deep influence on the psyche even on consciousness$ But LSD was being used incautiously by very many people.$ Legislation became inevitable.$ Here I'll propose a drug control away to provide stricter penalties for those who traffic an LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people$ In 1968 president Johnson took stern measures.$ The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young!$ Laws were passed in America and around the world banning LSD and determing it to have no medical value.$ There's 27000 people a year killed here in alcohol-related deaths.$ You don't see any big thing about alcohol being evil.$ There's... how many people smoking and dying of it.$ How many of all of these and yet nobody's been killed.$ Why is it that people think it's so evil, what is it about it that is...$ scares people so deeplyEven the goddamn.....what is it?$ Because they are afraid that there is more to reality than they have confronted.$ That there are doors that they are afraid to go in and they don't want us to go in there either because if we go in, we might learn something that they don't know.$ And that makes us a little out of their control.$ Did the establishment proscribe LSD because it revealed to the young a truth better concealed$ Lord William Deeds former M.P. – an editor of the Daily Telegraph - sat on the committee that advised the British government to ban LSD$ He denies metaphysical paranoia was involved.$ We are talking on the 60s, when all this things were?sought and thought and shared.$ And exact the same arguments were?on the habbit?of cannabis.$ in the sence the illi.... it was part of an attack on youth culture.$ That the middle-aged people drank and smoked and young people of a?use LSD and other.... all the different?$ the dangers to society that their subjects respectively pose.$ And in our mind then and in my mind now LSD posed an element of risk which exceeded any other the indulgences which civilizations were taking on board.$ It was never attack on young people, it was never a political measure - it was?$ on medical advice.$ As well as the medical dangers the committee in their report considered and then dismissed the possible spiritual benefits of LSD$ I find it very hard to accept, that LSD offers what we could seriously call a religious or spiritual experience.$ It can offer a transcendental experience, it can take you outside the sphere which you normally can think in, or you live in.$ But to relate that directly to religious belief, to religious revelation, if you like, should be taken with a pinch of salt.$ Few deny the reality of the psychedelic vision but many doubt its worth.$ Is there anything of value to be found in a hallucinatory irrational realm of LSD intoxication?$ The common way we think about the nature of human mind is that it is either sane or insane.$ LSD hints to us that there is a... an area of the mind which could be called" unsane" – beyond sanity, and yet not insane.$ Think of a circle with a fine split in it at one end is insanity, you go around the circle to sanity, and on the other end of the circle close to insanity but not insanity is" unsanity".$ This is perhaps where all the superlative effects of humanity come from.$ Not only of art but of science.$ And it may be that we are... we could approach it by a thoughtful wise study of LSD.$ Today the suggestion that there may be a good side to LSD could hardly be less fashionable.$ The drug has an appalling public reputation.$ Epitomized by this image of a naked girl deranged by LSD, which opened the recent TV dramatization of the operation" Juli" police rades.$ The romantic appeal drugs had in Aquarian age has gone.$ It's been replaced by sorted association with criminal exploitation and wasted lifes.$ Some blame LSD for glamorising drug

wanted too.$ This not how I become an addict I just do heroine slight problem look...$ I've this thing under control... just gonna touch a flinger-time?$ Everyone thinks" I can control heroine"$ until it starts to control them.$ I can give up tomorrow, good night.$ We could make a distinction between heroine, which is drug which creates physical dependence, and LSD, which is drug which has no physical dependence.$ And I don't believe you can make link between the use of LSD in 1960th and 1970th with the use of heroine and other drugs like that in the 1980th.$ In the 1960th and 70th people were using drugs like LSD believing that it was a means of gaining greater self-awareness, greater insight into their own being.$ In the 1980th people are using drugs like LSD as means of escaping reality, of avoiding the unpleasantness of life.$ Of couse, in a sense, it doesn't really matter what reasons people have for using it.$ What does matter, is that LSD is an extraordinaly powerful drug.Whose effect we can't really control and we can't control when we take it$ It creates so many risks for both those who use it and for society generaly that I believe we've gotten no choice, but to retain legal controls on its use.$ Aldous Huksley, who's early experiments with mescaline influenced popular interest in LSD, never lost faith in the value of psychedelic drugs.$ On the day he died from cancer in 1963Huxley asked his second wife Lora to inject him with LSD.$ That was the same day that the president Kennedy was assassinated.$ And we were right here in this room, it was then a soon end... and he was getting very weak and he said to me:$ " Give me big-big peace of paper" and he wrote intermuscular one under a miligram of LSD intermuscular and I've filled the syringe with it and I gave it to him.$ It was very quiet...$ And at certain point I said:$ " If you hear me squeeze my hand", and he did... very weakly...$ Then I thought...$ I had an impression that may be it was neccessary to give a second shot and I asked him and he has indicated$ I've given him second shot and that... well... then it was about 4 – 5 hours there was absolutely no jolt, no agitation, nothing, except this very very quiet...So..$ like a music that becomes less and less audible, like... going.... fading away.There was no jolt when he died it was just... that.... his breath stopped, and there was a beautiful expression in the face there was a very beautiful expression in the face.$ When Huksley died in 1963,LSD was already beginning its descent to denaturati$ And the advocates of Albert Hofmann's discovery were claiming for it the status of a religious sacrament.$ I think that many of the intellectuals of the 60th were really – failed priests.$ The're people who are looking for a priestly role in society, and in another age they would perhaps would join the church and subjected themselves to the discipline of the church.$ But they of course didn't have the necessary transcendental belief, or a necessary ability to sacrifice themselves.$ So that they took up LSD... as a religion in order to preach something to the multitude, and they had to have something to offers to the multitude, which in a consumer society means offering something quick, easy, and satisfying.$ And I think that in that way LSD was extremely dangerous in enhancing the ambitions of those people to preach when they should've actually been staying silently in their studies getting on with something respectable.$ The most important what I gained from LSD experience was the inside that, which commonly is believed to be the reality, is not something fixed, but rather ambiguous.$ I experienced another reality under LSD, and before I had always thought there is only one reality – a" true" reality and... but then I...$ I realized there are the dimentions of reality... subtitles performed by Rajaka Dharma Group$

- but quite far out to sea."$ " Since we will pass by the vicarage at Solberga, we could stop there and ask if the ice will bear our weight all the way to Marstrand."$ Generally, the dog was still and merely blinked at his master words.$ But when he heard something that displeased him, he climbed on top of the load they carried, pointed his nose skyward, and howled.$ " Dear dog, what do you have against Solberga?Have we not many times swung past the vicarage to pay visit to Sir Arne?"$ At the vicarage - the state known as Solberga - the vicar, Sir Arne, ate his supper in the company of his housefolk.$ The vicar was an old man who retained his dignity and vigor.Sir Arne...Hjalmar Selander$ While the years had not been kind to his wife.The vicar's wife...Concordia Selander$ Seated on the other side of Sir Arne was the curate.Curate...Gösta Gustafson$ At the far end of the table were Sir Arne's niece, Berghild, and her foster sister Elsalill, an orphan taken in by the vicar's household.Elsalill...Mary Johnson Berghild...$ The only person present not belonging to the household was Torarin and his gaze kept returning to the iron-clad chest at the foot of the four-poster bed.$ Though Torarin was a man of little means, he had no desire to possess this fortune, for he had heard that Sir Arne had taken the money from the large monasteries that once flourished in this country and that the old monks had prophesied that the money would bring ill-fortune.$ " Why are they sharpening knives over at Branehög?"$ " Tell me, why are they sharpening such long knives over at Branehög on this very night?"$ " Do you not hear the scraping and filing?$ Do you not hear the hissing and squealing?"$ " How can you hear them sharpening knives over at Branehög?$ That estate is miles away.$ Pray let us finish our supper.$ Act II$ That very evening a banquet was held at the inn at Branehög and all the townspeople were invited.$ " The old saying holds true:$ The closest neighbor is the last to arrive."$ " I'll still see them in my mind's eye - - sharpening their knives.$ God only knows what they plan."$ " Fortunately the lady vicar's vision was no more ominous than a few journeyman tanners preparing the tools of their trade."$ Long after mignight, a few men left the inn at Branehög in order to saddle their horses and return home.$ " Come out!$ Come out!$ The vicarage is on fire!"$ " Last night Sir Arne and his entire household were murdered by three men... who entered the house though the smoke-hole in the roof.. men dressed in rough hides."$ " Sir Arne's horse is gone... and so is the sleigh!"$ Act III$ The impoverished young maid, the sole survivor of the bloodbath, was taken by Torarin to come live with him and his mother in their cottage.$ Torarin's cottage was situated at the highest point of the island - -- - and all the Scottish mercenaries, mariners and fishermen, locked in by the ice at Marstrand, used to pass by his cottage on their way to see if the sea had begun to cast off its blanket of ice.$ Often were the times Elsalill gazed upon those who passed by.$ She would ponder how blessed they were, to have something to look forward to.$ She yearned for nothing on earth.$ " I am not wealthy enough, Elsalill, to feed and clothe you- - so that you may remain idle and nurture your grief."$ " Oh, Mother Katri!$ The last to be slain was my foster sister.$ She pleaded for mercy, but one of the men stabbed her in the heart."$ " Had I not hidden behind a wall, I would be with my dear foster sister now!"$ " I hope they are alive, so I may rip their hearts from their chests!$ I hope they are alive, so I may see them drawn and quartered!"$ " We did not come to frighten you, good maiden, but to ask you to share your tale with us."$ " We came to Marstrand to book passage to Scotland but all the fjords and sounds are frozen.$ Now we while away the hours, and would be much obliged if you would share your tale with us."$ " Show the gentleman you do not lack the breeding to respond properly, Elsalill!$ You were born to a higher station and are not a lowly fish wench."$ After that day, Sir Archie often ventured to Torarin's cottage to speak to Elsalill.$ " God himself has sent you to me, Elsalill!"$ " Elsalill, will you accompany me to Scotland... as my wife?"$ " There I will build you a castle - - of wich you will be the distinguished mistress."$ " Do you see the hair entwining my hand, Elsalill?$ Do you see the lock of fair hair?"$ " In this very same manner the hair of my foster sister was twisted around the hand of her killer."$ " We frighten ourselves, unnecessarily, Elsalill.$ Look, it was but a few sunbeams shining in from the window."$ " Sir Archie!$ Sir Archie!$ Why must you call the dead to mind?"$ " Leave me, leave me, Sir Archie.$ For now my mind dwells solely upon the dead."$ " Grim, my dear dog, you can no longer doubt that we travel across the sea.$ Look - - a large ship is locked in the ice."$ " What do you say?$ Shall we call to the skipper and see if he wants to buy our fish?"$ If the ice does not break, it would be impossible to set sail for Scotland.$ Sir Archie wishes to discuss this matter with the skipper.$ " A man like yourself, who travels everywhere and hears everything, do you know why God keeps the gates of the sea barred for so long...?$ " Once I spent a whole month in Bergen, when headwinds were so strong not a single ship could put out." The skipper...Gustav Aronson$ " You see, one of the ships stuck in the harbor was carrying a man who had stolen from the church.And he would have escaped, had it not been for the raging storm."$ " As soon as he was brought ashore, the weather turned beautiful and the wind grew peaceful."$ " Do you know why I asked why God keeps the gates of the sea barred?"$ " He requested passage to Scotland for himself and his men, but I do not like to have such ruffians aboard my vessel."$ Act IV$ Not long afterwards, Elsalill had a peculiar dream.$ She thought she saw her dead foster sister standing before her...$ Elsalill saw that they were in a room where the proprietress of the tavern had her maid stationed to wash dishes and tankards.$ Her sister seemed to beckon her to help wash.$ The next day, the dream lingered and would not fade and she was irresistibly drawn to the places her foster sister had taken her in the dream.$ " Rather than simply standing there, you might come in and give me a hand with the dishes."$ " Drink my brother!$ Sir Arne's treasure is not yet gone."$ She could not betray him.$ He was dear to her heart.$ She could not send him to be drawn and quartered.$ She could not bear to see his hands and feet seared off.$ " God bless you for coming to see me tonight, Elsalill."$ " Elsalill, I have not been to see you for many days, since grave thoughts plagued me.$ But when I happened upon you just now, my heart told me what I must to do - - to be released from my torment."$ " I weep, Sir Archie, for the love I bear in my heart for you is too strong."$ " Soon the sea will open and ships will be able to set sail to the country from which I come.$ Elsalill, won't you go with me?"$ " You must go with me, Elsalill, or I will be doomed."$ " Tonight I will come for you, Elsalill.$ I must have your decision... tonight."$ " Why are you out here weeping?$ Why did you not stay in the cellar?"$ " I left because I did not wish to hear the words of the evil-doers on your premises."$ " I happened, however, to hear three men talking and one said,'Drink, my brother, Sir Arne's treasure is not yet gone.'"$ " If you can witness such words, it is best not to flee.$ You must go with me to the rightful authorities so they may seize the murderers and duly punish them."$ Act V$ The skipper sent word to Sir Archie and his men that they may board ship this evening.$ The sea has begun to open up to the west.$ They may even escape to Scotland before dawn.$ " Go to the inn and settle things.$ I must speak to Elsalill before we depart."$ " Sir Reginald and Philip have gone to the inn while Sir Archie has gone to Torarin's cottage."$ " Make haste and fly, the town guards are after you!"$ " They are looking for the men who murdered Sir Arne."$ " Did you recognize me, Elsalill, and set them upon me?"$ " They are coming for you...$ Go!"$ " Have you considered that I will no longer have a hope of ever redeeming myself?"$ " Why did you do it, Sir Archie?"$ " We had been driven mad by hunger and the cold.$ We were senseless with drink.$ I did not know what I was doing."$ " Why do you betray me...$ just when I trustred you most?"$ " Do not fear me, Elsalill.$ I am again the man I once was.$ I have returned to my senses..."$ "... and no harm will befall you on this night either, I assure you."$ Using Elsalill as a shield, Sir Archie ran for the door.$ A wild wolf of the woods she had loved.$ An evil murderer she shielded with her own body.$ And as Sir Archie took another step, the pike plunged into Elsalill's heart.$ All night long the skipper paced the deck of his ketch...$ Who could know what possessed the skipper to be out on such a night as this.$ His crew was safely aboard ship, and so were the passengers destined for Scotland.$ It was not until dawn's early light that the skipper saw the sight he was longing for.$ Fjords and sounds were now open far out to sea.$ But the inlet where his ship was iced in showed no channels - - it was frozen solid.$ " I implore you to help me find the maid whom the Scotsmen brought to your ship last night..."$ " Last night she was abducted by the men who killed Sir Arne and they brought her to your ship."$ " The town guard will not venture out this far.$ Not to a ship carrying a hundred soldiers of fortune.$ They are unwilling to engage them in battle..."$ " Now I know why we have been held back...while all other ships may put to sea.$ It is because we have evildoers on board."$ " Stay calm and obey that man.$ This is the will of God."$ As soon as the criminals were brought to shore, the storm began to rage again.$ And from his lofty vantage point of deck, the skipper saw a lengthy procession approach his skip.$ It was the womenfolk of Marstrand, both young and old.$ They were clad in mourning, and youn men carried a bier.$ They had come to collect the young maiden who had loved an evildoer... and had given her life to destroy him.$ ... and in their wake, the tempest tore up the ice over wich they had but lately passed.$ By the time they reached Marstrand with Elsalill, the gates of the sea stood open.$ The end$ The musical score for Sir Arne's Treasure is the result of a collaboration between the Swedish Film Institute and Swedish Filmindustry$ The score was co-written by Matti Bye and Fredrik Emilson Instrumentatilst:$ Sir Arne's Treasure was restored by the Swedish Film Institute Archive in 2000.$ The original tints were recreated and footage discovered in London and Copenhagen has been restored.$ Subtitles:Ingrid Eng-Rundlow$

night is as long as 100 years on Earth.$ Night and day he must Carry out his master's business.$ END OF PART 1$ THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 2$ Wherever he goes, he's greeted with sorrow and despair."$ There is no escape.$ He must perform his forlorn duty."$ Though horse and carriage are always the same, the driver is not."$ The last soul to die each year - the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight - is destined to be Death's driver for the following year.$ Now you know why I'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year's Eve.$ And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve.$ Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?"$ Come with me, David Holm!$ Sister Edit is dying, and she has asked for you.$ If Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go to her at once!"$ David, I can't believe it's you!$ It is you who is to relieve me!"$ You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can."$ No living soul rides in that carriage.$ By the time I arrive, it's too late for a doctor.$ You know full well that I am no longer among the living."$ But worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime.$ David, do you think I'm unaware that it's my fault you've met such an end'?$ If you hadn't fallen in with me, you'd have led a good life with your wife, children, and brother.$ By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior.$ But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you.$ Behold your brother.$ While you were here, he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits.$ But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place, since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer.$ Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?"$ Yes!Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one.$ What about your wife and children?"$ Now I know how miserable they've been, but I will turn over a new leaf.$ They need never despair of me again.$ END OF PART 2$ THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 3$ No, she's not ill.$ She was well enough the other day when she left.$ And here I thought I'd come home to her with such joy!"$ If she had gone openly, I would have understood.$ But to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless!$ I'll wipe those smiles off your faces.$ I'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has now!$ I'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger.$ I will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came to this town, bringing such misfortune in your wake.$ A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town, and it was ready for use on New Year's Eve.$ Keep your food!$ I just want to sleep."$ Leave it alone!$ It may be full of germs, and our sterilizing oven isn't working yet.$ Don't you realize, Maria, how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us?$ Please go to bed.It's been a busy day.$ Let me attend to this.$ Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year."$ All night long she bent over the coat, never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled.$ By the time she went to bed, the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room.$ Was it you who mended my coat'?"$ Would you mind calling the person who did this?"$ It's a shame you went to all that trouble, miss, but I'm used to having it like this.$ Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year's Eve."$ You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year, and I'd like to know if my prayer was answered.$ Oh, I'll be here.$ I'll come show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle.$ The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here.$ From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed, and now she awaits your visit.$ You possessed all that is most wonderful, but you lost it!$ You cannot avoid the torment of remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year.$ " Captive, come forth from thy prison!$ Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office.$ For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm.$ END OF PART 3$ THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 4$ It is Death, but he has come too soon."$ You see that I'm not afraid of you.$ I will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's reprieve, for there is someone I must talk sense into.$ You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused.$ I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right.$ The person I'm waiting for is the man I love.$ Do you understand?$ The man I love!$ I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you.$ But you have no power over this man!$ Believing he was good, you've tried to make him mend his ways, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again.$ It was you who enticed him away from his home and work!$ You made him the drunkard he is!$ Don't let yourself be dragged under!"$ SALVATION ARMY RALLY$ Run along and be saved, and I'll be sure to come watch!"$ Why turn away so carefully?$ I'm a consumptive myself, but I cough in people's faces in hopes of finishing them off.$ Why should they be better off than us?$ He's merely amusing himself.$ He's not as wicked as he pretends to be."$ How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man'?"$ You needn't worry about that.I'll be leaving town in a few days."$ No, you mustn't do that!"$ I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again."$ Tempting as that may be, I still can't stay."$ You see, little missy, I'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone I must find at all costs.$ Who is this person you seek?"$ You'll know that when I find the person in question!"$ I am the one David Holm is looking for."$ I am his wife."$ I couldn't endure the life he was leading.$ I deserted him.$ I took my children and crept away in secret.$ I moved to this town, for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here.$ You must take him back!$ it's his only hope!"$ " I didn't mean you must make up your mind on the spot.$ Only promise you'll listen to your heart, and let us talk again later.$ She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.$ Just come with me!$ A surprise awaits that will make you happy.$ END OF PART 4$ THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 5$ She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns.$ And she may well have succeeded had it not been for...$ The doctor says it's pneumonia.$ And her resistance is poor, for she's been in ill health since last New Year's Eve.$ Yes, that David Holm has been her undoing.$ She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth.$ You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children!"$ It wasn't so easy to run away this time!"$ Haven't you had your fill of revenge, David'?"$ If only I hadn't brought them together again.$ His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me.$ You must grant me a reprieve!$ I cannot die yet!$ I must see him turn over a new leaf!$ Just spare me a few minutes!$ You know I love him!$ I've never loved him as I do today."$ Captive, ye of loving head, come forth from thy prison!"$ Come along.$ We have no business here.$ Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly.$ You know, David, if I could send a message to mankind,I would like to send them a New Year's greeting.$ " I would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer:$ 'Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped.'$ Why are we here?$ Surely no one here is going to die!"$ No, I can't go on!I can't go on!"$ I'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind."$ Please don't be angry with me.$ it's not my fault."$ This will do, David.$ It will suffice for the children and myself.$ " Yes, David, I see what's coming.$ I'm obliged to watch.$ I will not shirk my duty.$ You mustn't let this happen!$ This mustn't come to pass!$ Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!$ " I have no power over the living.$ Where should I turn?$ Should I pray to God or to Christ?$ Who can tell me where to direct my plea'?$ I'm a poor, miserable sinner, and I beseech the Lord of life and death!$ I'm not worthy.$ I've broken your every commandment.$ Condemn me to

you owing, David'?"$ No one believes I want to reform.$ I want to be good, but no one believes me.$ Is it any wonder I cry'?$ It's hard to believe, David.$ But I do believe you.$ Your tears have

what has the island to do with your heinous intrigues?$ On that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms accessible,$ especially created for love's celebrations.$ When you enter the grotto, a blue light dazzles your eyes.$ Heavy fragrances confuse your senses, crimson flames, flaring up like visions, distant music and soft singing lure you deeper and deeper.$ A narrow path leads to the cave's entrance, hidden by shrubs of roses.$ But if someone discovers the grotto's secret then we are lost.$ Does Salvago know about your doing?$ Salvago, ha ha!$ A whim of nature, if you like, a strange caprice.$ Genoa's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure,$ of this materialized idea of beauty.$ And he himself...$ He himself keeps away.$ Maybe he has regrets.$ But I don't understand

benefactor of people, he will obey, or woe to him and woe to you all!$ Our times are full of strange things.$ I knew a woman, like me she learned to paint at the Antwerp School, she painted hands.$ Fine, slim hands with delicate blue-veined structures, rough and strong fists of men,$ a woman's hand with rings, voluptuous and tender, with nails, pointed and rosy, flashing like drops of pale blood.$ There I saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig, growing out of green bushes.$ But the oddest thing was one painting:$ a hand, waxen and pale, pale as death, with weird long and skinny fingers,$ it was grasping something you could not see.$ Only a faint reddish gleam penetrated the eerie fingers, but this glow was like a silent dirge,$ like a suppressed moaning cry, like a scream, restrained and in mortal fear,$ like a restrained cry for release...$ But, the painting's meaning?$ The poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works:$ the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it.$ She may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event, some sensuously intoxicating charm to which she would surrender.$ How strange, fear of happiness?$ The driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was nourished was pain.$ Not mentally, a physical pain.$ Your hand, Signorina, is not as steady as your voice, if you want to paint...$ No.$ You are wrong!My hand is quite steady and the story soon comes to an end.$ My friend suffered from her heart since her youth.$ All too often it would beat too passionately and sometimes she felt as if a merciless hand clutched at the twitching thing and squeezed it, dreadful and aching,$ so that it may come to rest!$ This hand, this cruel hand$ she painted and her pain, too.$ Even though you deny it, you are deeply moved, so it really touched you?$ I loved her...$ So she died?$ I think she is still alive.$ Tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today... or rather why your eyes so fearfully evade mine.$ What have I done?Are you angry with me?$ Signorina Carlotta, if this is nothing but a game for you, the pleasure of playing around or even worse, then you are, despite your sweet face and your voice which sounds like a message from heaven,a devil!$ Why should I who am so good to you be as vicious and evil as you describe me?$ I implore you, don't be angry with me!$ Just have some patience with me!$ I don't understand:it is like a dream and I fear...$ No, do not fear!$ You are a man and totally without any self-confidence.$ is it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you?$ Ha ha!$ The old story!$ But the way you look, with eyes whose glow alone is promise...$ And when your mouth smiles I feel as if on earth there were nothing that is named"" friendship"", as if this word, this miserable word, were an absurdity, a lie and disgrace!$ And if it were more...$ I do not say it is...$ Should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that strives for you in love?$ For me... me who hates himself, who flees from himself, who banished the mirrors out of his rooms!$ A fool you are!$ Who like nobody else clings to that which slips away like a day in May:$ this bit of beauty which leaves us women when the first furrow is on its way!$ We are scarcely conscious of spring, when buds turn to fruit.$ The leaves wither and fall.$ And this should be the one thing?$ Did you never go out on a sunny day, gloomy and sad, without knowing why?$ And not even the most outstanding person, not the most flourishing tree could rescue you from your anxiety.$ And some other time, on rainy days, did it not make you happy, even overjoyed, to see an old, lonely man, wrinkled and ugly, who went on his way and looked at you with naive eyes?$ But if, on a glorious day, in a bed of the loveliest flowers, you were to find a grim monster which put you in a bad mood?$ But I notice one thing:$ you evade me, once with looks, now with words.$ But I have to tell you.$ Carlotta, consider...$ You shall know that I love you.$ Carlotta!$ For God's sake, Signor, how you do stare at me!$ There, take my hands, kiss them quickly!$ But let me go on working.$ I need your eyes for my painting.$ Thus they are right for me.$ Carlotta!$ Beloved!$ I beg you, do not speak.$ Just look at me just straight, look deeply into my eyes and think about beautiful things, that I am your sun that chases away all darkness from your life with streaming light.$ For God's sake, Carlotta, I must at your feet.$ I am happy beyond words.$ I beg you, stay.$ Just look at me and consider that never again will you be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness.$ See how calmly I say the word which tormented you for so long.$ Now it's over.$ Since it's a word... and a concept...$ Nothing more.$ But you must be good to me, Alviano, and tender, my dear!$ Because I am quite a fragile toy.$ Carlotta!$ That's it, it's finished.$ Now come and hold me.$ I am exhausted, yet you must...$ For all saints' sake...$ Dear, what happens to you?$ You sweet, poor one...$ You loveliest one!$ You gave life to me, you gave back to me the belief in God and mankind.$ I want to consecrate to you all I have.$ I want to spread myself

everywhere.$ Singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes...$ Carlotta's silvery laugh a while ago, but probably it was a delusion.$ Ah, sir, how changed and happy I am since the day you first entered my house.$ Your daughter, so soon to be my wife, how beautiful beyond words she is, so full of sincere kindness.$ But you are reserved.$ What troubles you, PodestÁ?$ I am bewildered and dazzled.$ What you have just shown me, it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic!$ Many people helped me.$ The artists were active.$ I only contributed the yearning.$ - But where is Carlotta?$ - Come on, let us look for her.$ Did you not hear?$ They are looking for you, Carlotta, and you hide yourself in the shadows.$ Then you run away from your fiancé?$ Don't think badly of me, Duke.After all I don't know what happens to me.$ Yesterday when I answered you"" No"" for Count Vitelozzo I felt proud and secure, grand and joyful.$ But yet, since I finished the painting, which pleased you so much,$ the portrait of Alviano,$ it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me, as if my love were no longer the same.$ Not poorer, don't get me wrong.$ But as though now he had given me his all, his everything and as though I had nothing... nothing more to expect.$ And further... yet I don't know if a woman's conflicting feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn, Duke?$ Pray, trust me, how true and authentic you are,Signorina!$ I came to this island full of secret fear.$ As if I had drunk wine, heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs, or that strange drink, brewed with the blood from the heart of a love-stricken virgin!$ It is the dreadful spell of beauty, normally bound, half-concealed from the senses and now raging, exposed to the daylight and lecherous eyes like a beautiful woman's limbs, shyly covered in the years of desire,$ suddenly enjoying nakedness, displaying its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth!$ O Duke, you who know life and women, you sinned against Alviano, but he sinned even more against himself, because when I saw him, there, with my father, in all this splendour he created through the burning power of his mind,$ when I saw him, the poorest, who himself tore the kind-hearted veils in which mercy wraps us as well as the strange power which tames the senses, then I remembered the saying of this unhappy one in his sole joyful hour:$ "" But if, on a glorious day,"""" in a bed of the loveliest flowers,"""" you were to find a grim monster...""$ - For

3701627$ A presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures.$ BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921.$ For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and to Mr. Richard Louw for the art direction.$ My main sources are mentioned in the theatre's playbill.$ Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the Witch.$ The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind.$ When primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible, the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits.$ In Persia, the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases.$ The English scientist Rawlinson and French scientist Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits, believed to have resided amongst the first civilizations.$ The belief in evil spirits, sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe.$ Here we see how the Egyptians perceived the shape of the world$ ( according to Maspero).$ The ancient Egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides.$ The sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains.$ The stars, like lamps, hung from the sky on ropes.$ According to the beliefs of other ancient civilizations, the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces.$ The evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils, sneaking around and tempting children.$ The devils lived in the earth's core.$ In the latter part of the Middle Ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe.$ Above the earth and its waters -$ - the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -$ - then a layer of fire -$ - and outside the fire were the planets, moving celestial bodies.$ Each planet was attached to its transparent, movable sphere.$ And outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own.$ Above it all, in the tenth crystal sphere, sits the Almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels and He is the One keeping the spheres revolving.$ Deep down in the earth's core lies Hell, where those tempted by the Devil shall suffer forever.$ In the upper part of the following picture$ ( from the French historian Lacroix)$ The devils are stuffing the damned into large pots.$ A sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons.$ A devil pours the nasty sulfur oozing from a horn down a man's throat.$ Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth.$ I have found a strange old mechanical presentation of Hell, which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.$ Observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons!$ During the Middle Ages, devils and Hell were considered real and constantly feared.$ Witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the Devil, and therefore they were burned at the stake.$ The floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air.$ This picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from" German Life in the Past in Pictures."$ In this image a witch is milking an ax handle.$ In the following image a witch has bewitched a man's shoe.$ Witches usually meet in councils.$ And after the gathering they might, for instance, sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow.$ The small angular symbol, noticeable under the drawing, was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches.$ In this old naive drawing, a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells, setting a village on fire.$ Witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer's powder and magic potions.$ Notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed.$ That was habitual in the past.$ It was a general belief that the witch was naked when, at night, during the so-called Witch Sabbath, she danced with the devils.$ Women who wanted to participate in the" Sabbath"$ sneaked away to the sorcerer where they could have their backs smeared with" witch ointment".$ The witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air.$ The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following pictures of the Witch Sabbath a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation.$ At the Sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the Church's holy cross.$ Satan gives all the participants devils' names.$ And a ceremonial banquet is held.$ The Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows.$ All witches had to show the Devil their respect by kissing his behind.$ After a merry dance with the devils, the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock.$ These scenes are often found on famous Witch Sabbath pictures from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.$ To be continued.$ THE WITCH Chapter 2.$ We go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488.$ " Tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows' hill."$ " Ugh, what a stench!$ The thief's body has been hanging too long on the gallows."$ " When such a thief's finger is too dried out, it can no longer lend the brew any healing power."$ " Hurry and open up, Karna, so that the passers-by won't see me."$ " Karna, can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?"$ " Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts, boiled in the moonlight."$ " A drop of this in a man's drink will soften his heart at once."$ " Karna, can I have an even stronger potion?"$ " If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love..."$ I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow."$ " Hold your coin, maiden!$ First smell my ointment!"$ " This salve is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken, one night."$ " Secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber."$ " You will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses."$ " Listen Brother, I wonder...$ shouldn't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise?"$ " Oh Holy Mother, forgive us for cutting open a person's dead body with a knife!"$ " It is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin..."$ "... but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us."$ " Help!Hurry!$ The peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches."$ Such were the Middle Ages, when witchcraft and the Devil's work were sought everywhere.$ And that is why unusual things were believed to be true.$ " Damned woman!$ You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people."$ " You watch out!$ Now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity."$ So it happens with witchcraft as with the Devil;$ people's belief in him was so strong that he became real.$ The Devil is everywhere and takes all shapes.$ He shows himself as a nightmare, a raging demon, a seducer, a lover, and a knight.$ The devils' companion can be young and beautiful, but she is more often old, poor and miserable.$ Is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night, you poor old woman of the Middle Ages?$ When the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes, the Devil fetches Apelone for his adventures.$ High up in the air is Apelone's dream castle, and there the Devil will fulfill all her secret wishes.$ To be continued$ THE WITCH Chapter 3.$ In" Rites and Rights in the German Past" by Franz Heinemann, we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work.$ A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not.$ In" History of Customs", Edward Fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up.$ Two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support.$ If she floats, she will be pulled up and burned.$ If she sinks, the judges thank God for her innocence.$ I will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the Pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to Germany.$ " Oh, my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly, unless a sorceress had bewitched him!"$ " Be comforted Anna, wife of the Printer, the power of lead will soon reveal it."$ " Oh, you powerful Saturn, allow this lead to show if Jesper the Printer is bewitched."$ " It is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft."$ " Oh Peter, look, where is the evil sorceress?"$ " You might see that witch, before you wish to..."$ "... before I wish to."$ " Jesus' Holy Cross and Wounds!$ I did not hear you come, Maria the Weaver!"$ " Oh, maiden, please have mercy on me, a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door!"$ " Are you hungry, Maria?$ If so, sit down."$ " Here, eat now, if you can, in the name of Jesus."$ " Watch out, little sister, watch out.$ That woman has evil eyes."$ " The youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden."$ " How wonderful!$ It felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm."$ " Young maiden, you know quite well that what you're accusing this woman of, endangers her life?"$ " Swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies!"$ " Let's go, young men, before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won't turn us all into mice."$ " Now you can have a scalding death, just what you deserve, you damned mistress of the Devil!"$ To be continued$ THE WITCH Chapter 4.$ Two" honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.$ " Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."$ " Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."$ The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.$ Two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.$ If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.$ " Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."$ " I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."$ " Does she see this length of consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"$ The accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber, so as not to bewitch the judge when entering.$ " For the last time I ask:Does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds?"$ " Let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart."$ " Oh, you learned men!$ How do you expect me to confess to that which is not true?"$ " Well, Rasmus the Executioner!$ Let now the evil witch's body sting."$ " Let her catch her breath, Rasmus the Executioner, and loosen the screw a little at a time, as she confesses her sins."$ " Oh, learned men!$ I confess thatI've given birth to many children fathered by the Devil."$ " And when I gave birth, Karna and all her coven helped me."$ " If I am spared the pain, I will confess that Trina has smeared me with witch ointment."$ " Oh yes, learned men, miserable me has flown through the night air to Brocken on Trina's broom."$ " And the Devil's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft."$ " And many a woman, who had not accomplished enough evil deeds, was treated miserably by the Devil."$ " And masses spat upon all that is holy."$ " And a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by Karna."$ " Listen, Maria the Weaver, did you also see how the Devil put his mark on the witches' foreheads?"$ " Oh, learned men, I saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind."$ " And Anna's mother, the wife of the Printer, who wished me a scalding death -"$ " - that damned woman, I saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant, that old fool, was also there."$ " And Elsa, who kicked me some time ago, she shall also burn at the stake."$ " She passed Martin the Writer's door one moonlit night with her sister."$ " And they cast a spell on Martin the Writer with the water they threw against his door."$ " And it was the very same night that death took Martin the Writer."$ " And now I will tell you everything about the witches, who yell after me in the street where I live."$ To be continued$ THE WITCH Chapter 5.$ In this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era.$ Each witch gives ten others away.$ The town wardens busy themselves.$ If you oppose the capture of a witch, you must be a witch yourself.$ The destiny of young Anna, wife of the Printer, is sealed.$ So now only two people are left in Jesper the Printer's haunted house.$ During the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly, but it was not safe to be young and pretty either.$ " Brother, help me.$ My thoughts are sinful."$ " Bare your body, Brother!"$ " I'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul, into faith healing."$ " Oh Brother, why did you stop the beating of the scourge?$ Now my soul will surely be damned."$ " Father Henrik, Brother John is spellbound."$ " A witch appears in his cell to tempt him."$ " And she has grabbed him by the wrist."$ " Stand up, Brother, Father Henrik is coming."$ " Brother, you have not given the maiden away for a witch, have you?"$ " You know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch?"$ And so they fetch you too, young maiden, giving you their unfailing test.$ " In the name of the Holy Trinity, if you are not a witch, you will now shed tears!"$ " See for yourself - you cannot shed tears, as you are allied with the evil one."$ We assume now that the young woman resists;that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess.$ I have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances.$ And I see in front of me some scenes, which I do not find pictured too darkly here, on the white screen.$ " Wake up, young maiden!$ I bring you great happiness."$ " See, young maiden, I give you your freedom if you would just show me a small favor in return."$ " Why do you taunt me, monk?$ What favor can a poor creature like me show you?"$ " Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water!"$ " If you do not want to take my word, young maiden, stand up and look out at the jail court."$ " Did the guards leave?"$ " Yes, they went far away, maiden.$ The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight."$ " And I swear eternal silence to you, maiden, about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder."$ " Do you remember, maiden, that Jesper, the Printer's child, is all alone in the world, without relatives besides you?"$ " Oh, Father Henrik, see the tears of the young maiden.$ Look, she cries, hence she cannot be a sorceress."$ Don't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle, so that we might believe it to be tears?"$ " Here, maiden, see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable, rejected witch's offspring without you."$ " Stand here and listen to all the maiden's words, so that later you may bear witness against her."$ " And will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me, if I speak?"$ " Then I will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me..."$ "... that when witches call for thunder, they put their hands in the water..."$ " You hardened witch!Before the sun is down tomorrow, you will burn alive at the stake."$ " And then they will burn you too, maiden,$ " as edification for man, as sweet scent for God."$ And one pyre after another burns in the town square, until the judges will one day move on to the next town.$ The witch madness, like a spiritual plague, ravages wherever these judges go.$ In the arc of a few centuries, over 8 million women, men and children were burned as witches.$ To be continued$ THE WITCH Chapter 6.$ There are witch confessions that are totally insane.$ Many women, for instance, confess that - transformed into cats - they soiled the altar during the night, while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door.$ But there are also confessions, which might very well be close to the truth, namely during the times when superstition ruled.$ Many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by" tying knots!"$ For each knot a pregnancy is destroyed.$ And the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses.$ Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects.$ But, if we should judge from the confessions, we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber.$ You and I would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools.$ Isn't that so?$ The French doctor Paul Regnard describes the way this collar was used.$ The collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes.$ The wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor.$ When a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck.$ Doctor Regnard shows another picture, which speaks for itself.$ It is simply called" After the interrogation."$ The" painful interrogation" preferably began with a" lighter" torture:$ The thumbscrew, for example.$ One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures.$ I will not reveal the terrible confessions I forced from the young lady in less than a minute.$ In the convents during the Middle Ages, fear of the Devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair.$ The pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment.$ Often a single nun was seized, and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -- a mysterious, contagious insanity.$ In writings that have survived to this day, these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the Devil penetrated the convent.$ " Get thee behind me, Satan!"$ " May all good saints stand by me!$ Sister Cecilia is conniving with the evil one."$ How these religious women must have suffered, before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out?$ In their biographies, this desperate cry is always found:$ The devil forced us into it!$ " Oh, Holy Mother, the evil has a terrible power!"$ " Look, now he forces me into doing what I want the least."$ " Burn me at the stake, pious fathers!$ Can't you see what the Devil forces me to do?"$ " Take me!$ Don't you see him?$ The evil one stands over there and threatens me."$ To be continued$ THE WITCH Chapter 7.$ We pass over the Devil's actual possessions$ ( speaking in tongues and convulsions)$ And come to present times.$ The majority of witches in the old days were poor women;those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays.$ One or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era.$ Let us not believe that the Devil belongs solely to the past.$ The lovely old woman, who plays the role of Maria the Weaver in my film, once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot -$ - and said:" The Devil is real.$ I have seen him sitting at my bedside."$ With the old woman's permission, I show here the prayer book in which a woman( from 1921!$ )$ Thinks she can tell the Devil by sight.$ The witch's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that I will try to exemplify here.$ I ask my viewer to understand that in the following I let the same actress portray many different patients of related nervous disorders.$ I have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep.$ Why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do?$ Like a witch forced by the devil, this woman both when sleeping and awake - gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches.$ Had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home?$ She stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own.$ Isn't there something" witch-like" with this sleepwalker, who moves through the slumbering household with her matches?$ Doesn't she remind us of the nun, who walks through the chapel with her knife, forced by the Devil?$ This poor woman, also in a bewildered condition, does during her sleep just what she fears the most.$ These possessions - these somnambulistic, dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria.$ And there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person.$ We remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the Devil.$ Today it is not the Devil, but rather a famous actor, a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor, who disturbs the calm of the night.$ The hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window.$ Notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed.$ A person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms.$ In the Middle Ages it was believed that during the Sabbath the Devil put some invisible marks on the witch's body, where all sensitivity vanished.$ The executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused.$ " I see clearly that you are a witch.$ You do not even feel the master's instrument on your back."$ Today, this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria.$ " No sir, I do not feel you touching my back at all."$ " Yes, it is as I thought; your daughter is suffering from hysteria."$ " From what you told me, I must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic."$ " It would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police."$ Poor little hysterical witch!$ In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the church.$ Now it is with the law.$ " I ask you to step into my office."$ " Or do you prefer that I call the police?"$ " Your name?$ Do you have a card?"$ " Your address?$ Do you have a telephone in your home?"$ " Thank you, that's fine.$ You can leave.$ I will contact you later."$ " If my family learns about this, I will be forcefully detained."$ " I beg you to understand that I am an unhappy, sick person.$ I do not know what I am doing."$ " I have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war.$ I am a broken person."$ " It is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft."$ " Look here!$ I just stole this little, expensively bound Russian book."$ " What shall I do with it?$ I do not know a word of Russian."$ " My husband died in the war, and I have not been the same since..."$ " I promise not to pursue this matter, but I have to ask you never to visit my store again."$ Centuries have passed and the Almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere.$ We no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils.$ The witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops.$ But isn't superstition still rampant among us?$ Is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now?$ We no longer burn our old and poor.$ But do they not often suffer bitterly?$ And the little woman, whom we call hysterical, alone and unhappy, isn't she still a riddle for us?$ Nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic.$ And then we will console ourselves with the notion that

love.$ It blossomed like a fragrant summer flower, unaware of the approaching fall.$ Alas, their bliss soon came to an end.$ As a samurai, Mochizuki had to return to his hometown and serve his lord.$ The samurai destiny is a loveless one.$ It was a tearful farewell.$ But Omitsu already carried a child.$ Before long, she gave birth to a beautiful boy.$ The condescending attitude of her fellow villagers forced the young mother to leave her home for a life in exile.$ Years later.$ A mountain path$ Two thieves are chased by police.$ Meet Heiji, the Boss and Lucky Santa.$ Tokutaro, the candy

west.$ Take my money.$ Please!$ I'll take it.$ Thanks!$ What are you doing?$ Return it.$ Here you go.$ Take care.$ So you won't change your ways?$ Another member of the gang,$ Senkichi, was injured

Thank God!$ This man is hurt.$ Can you please carry him.$ I will pay you.$ Thus Tokutaro saved Senkichi's life.$ Heiji lays the trap for his next prey.$ A samurai and his wife walk right into it.$ Hey, wait.$ Wait a second.$ Santa's job is to stop them.$ Heiji appears out of the blue.$ Give us your money, or I'II kill you!$ Tokutaro and Senkichi, the former ruffian, rush to the scene.$ Stop

made up his mind.$ So Heiji took the road alone.$ Wait!$ I'll change!$ Let me join you.$ Please!$ I want to become a honest man.$ Good!$ Good for you!$ The decision to join Tokutaro and Senkichi filled Santa with joy and hope.$ The samurai and his wife too were moved by the brave little boy.$ Deserted by his henchmen, Heiji went on alone.$ " An ill life makes an ill end."$ A sense of loneliness came over him.$ His two friends left him like tree leaves blown by the cold autumn wind.$ " I miss them."$ " Yes...I'm lonely."$ Heiji felt he couldn't go on.$ It was in this moment of loneliness and desperation that he saw the truth$ The sweet and gentle words of the little boy moved him deeply.$ " What a wasted life."$ The realization shook him deeply.$ He had to leave the life of vice and take the path of virtue.$ This was his last chance.$ Hey, wait!$ We can't leave him alone.$ Master!$ Wait.$ I am sorry.$ Please, let me join you.$ You're an amazing boy.$ That's great!$

the candy business flourished.$ These are fit for an emperor.$ Yummy candies.$ In this town lived a famous master of the sword, a middle-aged samurai known by the name Mochizuki Sanzaemon.$ Sanzaemon was a brave and gentle man, but a long-hidden secret of his past cast a shadow over his life.$ Mochizuki had never married.$ He declined all attempts of well-wishers to find him a wife.$ " Where is Mochizuki?"$ Osaki, the only daughter of the swordmaker Bizenya, was deeply in love with Mochizuki.$ Her love was not a happy one.$ Osaki, played by Shizuko Mori.$ She had the budding beauty of a fresh plum flower.$ Forlorn was the love that flickered in her heart, as she had given up all hope of ever marrying Mochizuki.$ What's clouding your thoughts,$ Mochizuki?$ Oh, Osaki.$ Her love filled him with remorse.$ " Forgive me.$ I already have a wife and a child."$ That is right.$ He is the samurai who ten years ago fell in love with Omitsu at Kosuzume Pass.$ The lively voices of the candy boy and his friends are all over the market.$ Everyone loves them.$ Meet the chief retainer's son, a vain woman-chaser, Kasuya Momonosuke, played by Tsumasaburo Bando.$ Momonosuke and his younger brother, Samon, attend the local shrine.$ Seeing the lovely Osaki enraptured by Tokutaro, Momonosuke swoops down on his prey.$ Heiji, Santa and Senkich give the wretch a good lesson.$ Nice one!$ Good!$ Get out of my way!$ Wait!$ Hey, stop!$ Brother, please!$ They are made into a laughing stock.$ October 5$ Today Mochizuki is invited in the home of the swordmaker.$ Welcome.$ Please.$ The most

memories.$ Omitsu's song.$ The face of his long-lost love floated in and out of his mind, haunting him.$ What's the matter, Mochizuki?$ That song...$ Come, come!$ Milady, let's take a look.$ Excuse me.$ From her balcony Osaki saw the merry candy men selling sweets to the amused crowd.$ Oh, it stuck!$ Come on, yummy sweets!$ What is it, Osaki?$ Candy men.$ There's a boy with them.$ Mochizuki seems to like their song.$ Let's call them here.$ We will call the candy men here.$ Will you do that for me?$ Yes.$ There's something about that song.$ Thank you.$ We'll be right back.$ Come, Osaki.$

Her name was Omitsu.$ Omitsu?$ !$ Yes, sir.$ Omitsu.$ I see...$ Excuse me, sir, but are you...$ " He is my son."$ " There is no mistake.$ He is my son!"$ Are you my father?$ I know you are!$ Father, Father!$ I've been looking for you.$ It's me, Tokutaro, your son!$ You're mistaken.$ I'm not your father.$ Yes, you are!$ The boy told the sad story of his mother's death and his lone journey to search for his father.$ I was told my father is a samurai.$ Every word pierced Mochizuki's heart like a knife.$ What a sad story.$ If your father were here today, he would be so proud of you.$ Yes, so proud and happy.$ Psst.$ Let's leave them alone.$ Come on!$ Please, come over here.$ There are more refreshments for you.$ Please, this way.$ After the wise swordmaker took the rest away,Mochizuki's suppressed emotions emerged in a wave of love and remorse.$ I am your father.$ Father!$ Father!$ Can you ever forgive me?$ Father!$ Father and son met at last.$ I am really your father.$ Thus Tokutaro was recognized by Mochizuki as his firstborn son, and his friends became apprentices in the samurai's household.$ Look at this face!$ The face of an honest man!$ We've all changed a lot.$ In an amazing turn of events the candy boy became a noble heir.$ Next, Tokutaro had to be introduced to the local lord.$ Mochizuki solemnly advances among the retainers, and proudly introduces his son to the lord, asking for his patronage.$ However, in an attempt to humiliateMochizuki and his son, the spiteful Kasuya brothers try to spread the story of Tokutaro's past as a candy boy.$ You!$ Wait!$ So he was a candy boy.$ How unusual.$ A good son of his father.$ We've seen him, many of you noble men don't know the candy boy.$ Won't you give us a little demonstration?$ We'd rather be excused.$ But we want to see!$ How dare you refuse!$ Father, please...$ Alright.$ Thus Tokutaro had to perform his song under the cold stares and arrogant smirks of the samurai.$ It was a painful moment for Mochizuki, seeing his son humiliated in front of everybody.$ Kasuya's servants further spread the rumor.$ Really?$ A candy boy?$ And now a samurai?$ Phew, candy samurai.$ Ha-ha!$ Heiji finally ran out of patience.$ Shut up!$ You, scum!$ Shut up!$ That's funny!$ You can't beat a candy boy.$ Come!$ Blinded by rage, Heiji smashes Kasuya's servants.$ This is hilarious.$ Well, Mochizuki, what do you think?$ He should become an entertainer.$ It's a waste to train him to be a samurai.$ True, true!$ Watch your words!$ Don't forget where you are!$ My lord, forgive me.$ A while later...$ Kasuya Samon and his servants were returning from a walk when they met Tokutaro.$ Is that him?$ Tokutaro slowly approached.$ The candy boy!$ Are you alright?$ Hang on!$ Leave me alone.$ It's the candy boy!$ Hey, wait!$ Master Kasuya.$ You'II never be a samurai, candy boy!$ Come, come!$ He's a candy boy.$ A fake samurai.$ Watch your words!$ Shut up!$ Please, leave us alone.$ Senkichi tried to stop them, but his words fell on deaf ears.$ Impudent worm!$ You're a shame to the name of the samurai.$ Useless candy boy!$ Please, let me go.$ Got it?$ I don't like you!$ Lowlife!$ You silly boy!$ Do you dare?$ Take out your sword!$ Please, master!$ By chance, Heiji came along.$ Let go of me!$ Heiji easily defeated Samon, but things did not end there.$ Mochizuki's mansion.$ Bizenya and Osaki were paying a visit.$ Hurry!$ The boy...$ The boy?$ Kasuya....$ What happened?$ Are you alright?$ That bastard Samon!$ What happened, Tokutaro?$ Tokutaro?$ Are you hurt?$ It looks painful.$ How did this happen?$ Who did it?$ It was Kasuya Samon.$ What he did was outrageous, so I struck him back.$ I couldn't stop myself.$ Forgive me, master.$ I see.$ You did what you had to do.$ Master, let me take responsibility and commit seppuku!$ Don't!$ Don't do anything hasty!$ I take all responsibility.$ At this moment Momonosuke and his servants broke into the house.$ Stop!$ Come no further!$ This is for my brother!$ Beware!$ Mochizuki, I'm coming to take your life!$ Flashing swords clash with a fearful hiss.$ Kasuya cuts Bizenya in cold blood.$ " The despicable cowardl"$ Enraged, Mochizuki faces Kasuya in a life-and-death battle.$ In the end, Mochizuki deals a deadly blow to the vicious Kasuya Momonosuke.$ Inspired by Mochizuki's righteous anger, the rest fought like lions.$ The outrageous Kasuya clan is the one that strays from the true samurai way.$ Come on, bullies!$ Come, come and fight!$ I'll show you!$ Hey!$ How do you like this?$ !$ The custom that upheld the superiority of the samurai class led to this hideous bloodshed.$ " Unjust customs consume us like cancer."$ " And still we broke them and committed a horrible crime."$ Mochizuki was torn up by shame and remorse.$ " If

4260078$ I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it!:$ In the great Gold Rush, Alaska was the hope and dream of men, the ruthless siren of the Far North, beckoning thousands to her icy bosom.$ Beckoning thousands to her unknown regions.$ Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields.$ Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship.$ Many lost their lives.Some fell by the wayside, others lost courage and turned back.$ But the brave went on.$ Far into the icy north, deep into the silent nowhere, came an undaunted lone prospector.$ And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector.$ With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended, then stopped, stepped, slipped and slid.$ " Now let me see", thought the little fellow.$ " Before I know where I am, I must get there."$ There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true, and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky,$ " Eureka!$ I've found it, a mountain of gold!"$ But the elements laughed, roared and thundered.$ In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin, and another lone man, Black Larson, an unmitigated, predatory scoundrel.$ Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality.$ There he sat, resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole.$ " Come here", said Larson.$ " What are you doing?"$ " Eating, obviously."$ " Get out."$ " Go on!"$ " Get out!"$ The wind also was giving Big Jim his troubles.$ Big Jim was the noble type.$ He had suffered.$ Oh, how he loved to suffer.$ He suffered about everything.$ " Get out", said Black Larson.$ " Or I'll fill you both full of lead."$ " Now then, the pair of you, get out!"$ " Out!"$ That kind of noise Jim don't tolerate.$ " I'll stay right here, understand?"$ " Right here", said Big Jim.$ " Yes, sir, he'll stay right here", said the Little Fellow.$ " Understand?$ We stay right here."$ And stay they did, for days and nights.The cabin moaned and groaned.$ Two men walked and never talked, hunger gnawed their bones.$ " I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.$ " I must have food!"$ " What are you eating?" Said Black Larson.$ " Nothing."$ " Open your mouth!"$ " Liar!$ It's that candle."$ " That?" said the Little Fellow.$ " How revolting."$ " If I thought you were holding out on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"$ " One of us must brave that storm, if we're to get food."$ " Come here, the pair of you."$ " We'll cut the cards and the low man goes."$ " You're the man", said Jim.$ " Goodbye, good luck."$ " Don't forget to bring home the bacon."$ Somewhere in that nowhere, the law was looking for Black Larson.$ Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day.$ Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for.$ " Not quite done yet, give it two more minutes."$ " Come on, come on", said Big Jim.$ After scouring the country for food, the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing, not even a field mouse.$ From the pangs of hunger,$ Big Jim was becoming delirious, hysterical.$ In fact he was a pain in the neck.$ " Food, food!" he thundered.$ " I can put another shoe in the pot."$ " No, no, anything but that!"$ Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.$ " What's the matter?" Said the Little Fellow.$ " I thought you were a chicken."$ " Well, build up the fire", said Big Jim.$ " What's the matter with you?" Said the Little Fellow.$ " Come, my pretty bird", said Big Jim.$ " Don't be childish."$ " Hey, quit it.$ Don't be foolish, it's me!"$ " You!" said Jim.$ " I'm sorry.I must be crazy."$ " You're telling me", said the Little Fellow.$ " You go inside.$ I'll take the gun in case you lose it."$ Chicken or no chicken, the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim.$ Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.$ Then came the parting of the ways,$ Big Jim to his mine, our hero to his fate.$ " Goodbye", said the Little Fellow.$ " It's been a great pleasure knowing you."$ Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold.$ Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk.$ Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds,$ Black Larson swept on to impending doom.$ And out of a dream in that frozen waste, a city grew.$ And humanity warmed it with living, loving and desiring.$ Georgia.$ Jack was a ladies' man.$ Georgia was quick and impulsive, proud and independent.$ In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl.$ Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.$ Perhaps that's why she resented him.$ Out of the night came the Little Fellow, towards the dancehall, that beacon light of pleasure, that retreat of lost dreams.$ " Georgia, why aren't you nice to Jack?"$ " I believe he really likes you", said the girl.$ " He likes everybody", said Georgia quite audibly." I'm bored with this place", she continued.$ " I'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile."$ " Don't worry, I'll find him someday."$ Then she turned and looked and looked and looked.$ " Kinda fresh, ain't ya?" Thought Jack.$ " Get down off that high horse."$ " Me and you are gonna dance."$ " Hey there, pan out a tune."$ " Just a moment, I said we're gonna dance."$ " I beg your pardon", said Georgia.$ To show her utter contempt for Jack, she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall.$ " Yes, you.$ " You see, I'm very particular about whom I dance with."$ And there he stood, the dauntless cavalier, guarding... her sanctuary.$ " If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend",$ " you should put your hat on straight, like this!"" Take that you...$ " Huh!Very good."$ Hank Curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall.$ Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North.$ Hank was kind and human, and our hero cold and hungry, and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot.$ So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast.$ Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory.$ Hank's partner arrives.$ Both are ready to leave on a long expedition.$ Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away.$ " Goodbye", said Hank.$ " And don't forget to feed the mule."$ Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia, but an incident was to bring them together again.$ There she stood, her loveliness lighting the room, filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted.$ As she introduced her friends, his heart began to sing.$ As they warmed up by the stove, he excused himself to get firewood.$ And in that cabin his secret was revealed, his love for Georgia.$ And the girls giggled and laughed, perhaps in order to hide their pity.$ For in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts.$ And so they thought they'd have a little fun with him.$ There in the gloaming they sat, their faces alight with mischief, but all the while his heart was singing.$ And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair.$ He knew she was fooling, but he was happy.$ For she was near him, holding his hand, smiling at him.$ " Nice place you have here", said Georgia.$ " I hope you will invite us again."$ What if she were fooling?$ He was enjoying the warmth of her attention.$ And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair.$ And now she was leaving.The light of her loveliness would be gone.$ And he would be left with an emptiness, to return to his bleak, lonely existence.$ " Pardon me", said the Little Fellow,$ " But, uh..." He was lost for words.$ " Would you really like to come again?"$ " Of course", said Georgia.$ " What do you say, girls?"$ " We'll come for dinner New Year's Eve", said the ladies.$ " Very well", said Georgia." We'll come to dinner New Year's Eve."$ Of course at that moment Georgia would forget her gloves!$ For the next few days the Little Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year's dinner.$ The eve of a new year.$ New hopes and new dreams.$ And there was Georgia, caressing him with her smiles and tender glances.$ And the girls called for a speech.$ But he was too happy to speak.$ All that mattered was Georgia was there.Georgia!$ So he muttered and stuttered and finally said,$ " I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance."$ And a dance he did, with the rolls.$ Should auld acquaintance be forgot$ And never brought to mind$ Should auld acquaintance be forgot$ And days of auld lang syne$ For auld lang syne My dear$ For auld lang...$ In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia's mind.$ " Let's go up and visit the Little Fellow", she said.$ " We'll have some fun with him", said Jack.$ " We'll send Georgia in first, then give him a scare."$ " Oh, forget it", said Jack.$ " How about giving me a little attention?"$ A day or so later in the Recorder's office,Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold.$ " Where is this place?" they said.$ But Big Jim's memory had failed him.$ All he knew was that it was near the cabin.$ " The cabin, that's it!"$ " F I could find my way to the cabin I could find the mine."$ " But I can't remember."$ " Hey!" said Jack," Georgia's been looking for you."$ The Little Fellow knew otherwise.$ How dare that cad mention her name so lightly?$ For two pins he'd give him another thrashing.$ However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult.$ But it was true.$ Georgia had been looking for him.$ Georgia had written him a letter.$ And as he went looking for Georgia, so Big Jim went looking for him.$ " You, you!" said Big Jim.$ " You!$ The very man I've been looking for!"$ " The cabin, the cabin!$ Where is it?"$ " Answer me, I say!"$ " Can't you speak, man?$ Tell me!"$ " Where's the cabin?$ Where is it?"$ " At last I shall find my mountain of gold."$ " To your feet man, quick!"$ " You're coming with me!"$ " Take me to the cabin and I'll make you a millionaire!"$ " Georgia!$ Just a moment", said the Little Fellow.$ " Georgia, you don't have to explain.I understand."$ " I love you.$ I'll take you away from this life."$ " I'm going away, and when I return",$ " I shall come back."$ Exhausted and footweary, they arrived at the cabin.$ " Ah!" said Big Jim," it won't be long now."$ " Bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine.$ " Here, take a swig of this.It'll put hair on your topcoat."$ " My, this is a heavy lamb chop", said the Little fellow.$ Then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke, and again the elements laughed, roared and thundered, but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered.$ Then came the dawn.$ The Little Fellow awoke, blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before, but feeling definitely conscious of" the morning after".$ " Oh well, may as well tidy up and get breakfast."$ " This is the worst liver attack I've ever had."$ " Feel that rocking?"$ " It's the stomach."$ " It's not the stomach."$ " Let's go to the other side."$ " We'll see how far it will go over."$ " Something must be missing underneath."$ " I'll go outside and see what it is."$ " Now", said Big Jim," don't get excited."$ " Take it easy, don't move, don't breathe!"$ " I said don't breathe, stupid."$ " You can be most annoying at times."$ " If you'll only be cool, be calm", said Big Jim,$ " We have nothing to worry about."$ " Now show a little character!$ Where's your willpower?"$ " Now listen, I've got a very good idea."$ " Hold your hands like this, then I can get out first."$ " You see what I mean?" Said Big Jim.$ " Your mind is chaotic.$ You have no psychology."$ " You have no control."$ And Big Jim discovered his claim!$ " Now we shall be rich", said Jim.$ " We shall be millionaires!"$ And so they were.$ Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey.$ To live, laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury.$ They were famous, and sought after by the press.$ In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon.$ The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow's life story,$ " From Rags to Riches", and he graciously consented.$ And Big Jim was manicured.$ " Not the nails", said he," the corns".$ The reporter thought of a good idea, to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes.$ It would make a human story.$ Georgia...$ There she was in the steerage.$ Neither knew of the other's presence.$ Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard.$ " You!" said Georgia.$ " I thought I'd never see you again."$ And then she mistook him for the stowaway.$ The officer was going to put him in irons.But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare.$ " Heck!" said the Captain." That's no stowaway."$ " That's Big Jim's partner, the multimillionaire."$ Then of course there were apologies.$ The Little Fellow gathered himself together.James, the valet, was told to prepare for an extra guest.$ " Pardon me", said the reporter," but who's the lady?"$ " Buzz buzz buzz!"$ " Oh, you don't say!Well, congratulations."$ " This will make a great story, and with a happy ending."$ And so it was.$ A happy ending.$

3654508$ Jacques Feyder, the author of" Le Grand jeu"$ " Pension Mimosas" and" La Kermesse héroïque"$ produced almost half his work before the talkies arrived.$ He began in 1915 at Gaumont and, in 1921, had his first international hit with" L'Atlantide" based on the novel by Pierre Benoît.$ " Crainquebille" his second independent film, which came out a year later, was in a more realist vein.$ It related the misadventures of a street merchant struggling with French justice.$ The" Faces of children" project started as a commission from two producers in Lausanne,$ Dimitri de Zoubaloff and Arthur Porchet, who thought the director of" L'Atlantide"$ could produce a work of international renown.$ A unique film, directed and written by Feyder,$ " Faces of Children" owes a lot of its psychological truth to Feyder's own family situation.$ And especially to the support of his wife and collaborator,$ Françoise Rosay.$ She was his assistant on the set, and when Feyder went to Vienna for a fortnight to negotiate his next contract, she stood in for him, supervising the link shots at Joinville studios.$ Another collaborator whose contribution was essential was the great Léonce-Henri Burel.$ Abel Gance's own cinematographer, he'd already worked on Crainquebille the technical wizardry of which had contributed to Feyder's reputation as a master.$ For" Faces of Children"$ Burel glorifies the rough beauty of the Valais countryside, making it a central character, like the great Swedish films of Sjöström and Stiller.$ Feyder and Burel also pulled off some technical feats, like the night scene lit purely by torches, when the villagers search for the girl lost in the snow.$ This at a time when night scenes were usually shot in daylight, and then tinted blue or green during the editing.$ Even more surprising, is this avalanche scene with the camera surfing on the glacier as it hurtles down the mountain.$ The critics of the time appreciated this authenticity, already evident in" L'Atlantide"$ for which Feyder had shot several exteriors in the Sahara.$ For" Faces of Children" cheating was not an option.$ Feyder simply took his whole crew to Switzerland, to the Haut Valais, and shot the exteriors there during the spring and summer of 1923.$ Real peasants, some of whom had never seen a camera before, or even been in a cinema, were the extras, providing much depth to scenes like that of the funeral cortege and the wedding scene, shot in the village of Grimenz.$ Only the interiors of the chalet and the chapel buried under snow were shot in Joinville studios, in Paris, as were some link shots.$ Besides its authenticity, what still strikes us about the film is the very modern way it looks at unhappy childhood, without sentimentality.$ French films had featured children since before the war, but only as cute and amusing puppets.$ No one thought of studying them as real characters.$ So Feyder was making a radical breakaway from the usual comedies and melodramas by telling a sombre story without literary credentials or comic relief.$ To do this, he had a small but significant asset:$ Jean Forest, a kid of the streets of Montmartre, who'd been in" Crainquebille"$ a natural actor of incredible sensitivity.$ Once the film had been shot, a disagreement between Feyder and the distribution company,$ Les Grands Films Indépendants, meant that the reels were seized and Feyder had to wait a year to complete the editing.$ " Faces of Children" finally came out in March 1925 and was immediately hailed by the critics as a landmark, although the public stayed away.$ A first restoration of the film was done in 1986, by the Belgian Cinémathèque Royale, using material from Brussels, Amsterdam and Lausanne, as well as additional material from the Cinémathèque Française which it had already restored.$ Two elements were still missing:$ the titles and the colour, which was very important in Feyder's silent films.$ In 1993, as part of the" Lumière" project of the" Média" programme, with the participation of the Belgian Cinémathèque Royale, the collaboration of the Cinémathèque Française and the support of Gosfilmofond in Moscow, the Nederland Film Museum in Amsterdam$ undertook a new colour restoration, using two nitrate prints coming from two different negatives as well as three acetate reels.$ Finally, in 2004,$ Lobster completed this restoration with digital technology, stabilising the image and reducing the spots and stains.$ At the same time, the original French titles were restored from two 17.5mm prints in its collection.$ " Faces of Children" is a cinematic masterpiece about the world of childhood.$ Jean Mitry wrote, in his" History of cinema", that" besides the" Napoleon" triptych and" Chapeau de paille d'Italie" If I had to pick out one film of French production for this decade it would, without a doubt, be" Faces of Children".$

convent.$ You won't teach me anything.$ Let go of my wrist.$ I met babies like you before, Saint Cecilia.$ There's only one way to treat them and that's rough.$ There, that's something to think about.$ What's going on here?$ It's just that precious infant of yours getting temperamental again.$ Don't you two ever stop fighting?$ here I am, working like a dog trying to learn her the business.$ Never mind.$ What do you think that dirty little Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning?$ He said he ain't gonna give me a contract for the new stock season... till I've been in the show for two weeks

Me, Kitty Darling, dancing for a lot of drunk stags.$ Well, what of it?The problem with you and that kid of yours is you're both getting too high-hat.$ Why, Hitchy.$ What's the matter with you,

nice, won't you?$ I'm not a gorilla.$ But I don't know you.$ Well, use your chance.$ No, listen, here's the idea.$ Why not let's stop somewhere and get something to eat?$ There's no harm in that.And if you don't like the cut of my gib I'll be on my way.$ Well, that seems fair enough.$ I always eat after the show anyway.$ Now you're talking.$ Say, you're nice.$ You don't look like a show girl.$ Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.$ No kidding, I like you.$ And I guess you're not so bad yourself.$ Come on, Wisconsin.$ Boy, was I hungry.$ Me too.$ Gee, you don't know how much I appreciate this.$ I mean, I've been cruising around town all evening... up one street and down the other.No kidding.Just looking for somebody to talk to.$ Sailors don't generally have much trouble finding company.$ Oh, I don't want the kind of company you mean.$ Listen, all sailors ain't a bunch of bums.$ But you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this.$ Maybe I have.$ Aw, a girl like you lonesome.$ So, what's your name, anyway?$ I've been so excited about finding you I forgot to ask.$ April?No kidding?$ Sounds like a name out of a book.$ I don't know, though.It sorta fits you.$ Sounds sweet, sort of gentle.$ Just like I bet you are.$ Oh, you say the same thing to every girl you meet.$ How could I?I never met a girl named April before.$ What's your name?$ Tony.I don't like it much.$ Sounds like a white bootblack.$ Oh, no, I think Tony's a nice name.$ You do?$ Tony and April.$ Sounds nice together, eh?$ Gee, but your eyes are blue.$ Eat your chocolate cake.$ April.Why the little...$ Hello, Ed?Did April come in yet?$ She didn't?$ Are you sure?$ Thanks.$ The little...$ Those big waves...Gosh, they look to be about as tall as the Woolworth building, pretty near.$ They'd come down over the bough, crash.$ And the ship would shake like it was gonna split in two.$ One big wave after the other.$ Boy, all night we didn't know if we was gonna weather it or not.$ Well, anyway... next morning the sun was shining the ocean was as smooth as glass.And right up the starboard was the coast of China.$ It must be wonderful to sail all over the world that way.$ Oh, I don't know.You get tired of it just like anything else.$ I got a week to make up my mind if I'm gonna enlist again.$ I suppose I will.$ Sorry, pal.$ Closing time.$ But the park is still open.$ Okay, skipper.$ I had no idea it was so late.$ Here you are.$ Gee, I don't want to lose you so soon.$ Just when we were getting acquainted.$ Can't we find some other place?$ But it's

it?$ Yeah.$ Pretty soon the sun will come up and the people will wake up.$ and even you and I will go right on the way we were before.$ Just as if we'd never met at all.$ Say, don't kid yourself.$ I'm gonna camp right on your doorstep the rest of the time I'm on leave.$ How long is that?$ Saturday.$ This is Tuesday.$ That makes four days.$ And then you'll forget all about me.$ No, sir.$ Never.$ Yes, you will.$ You'll go sailing away from me, just like that boat down there will now.$ A tanker going out with the tide.$ Ships have to go out with the tide, don't they?$ And sailors have to go with their ships.$ And the world is full of other rivers and bridges with girls to sit on them till the tide goes out.$ Oh, April, I'm not like the rest of those gobs.$ Sometimes I think there are people who were just meant to be lonesome.$ You know, and then they'll meet someone for a little while and it gives them something to remember.$ So their lonesomeness doesn't hurt so much for a while.$ I don't know how to say what I mean.$ Yes, but if those people meet the right people they get together for keeps.$ Then they ain't lonesome anymore.$ But the right people don't seem to find each other very often.$ Yeah, ain't it the truth.$ Well, Tony...$ Well...$ I've got to go home.$ I don't want to, but I've got to.$ Right.$ Let me help you down.$ Good night.$ Or rather, good

right after you.$ Wouldn't that be silly?$ Look, the Woolworth Building.$ Yeah.$ That's some sight, isn't it?$ Oh, it's wonderful.$ You are wonderful.$ Well, there's the sea.$ Yes.$ Look at the old Statue of Liberty.$ I bet if I stood here I could see your ship when it leaves tonight.$ I should wave my handkerchief.$ What are you laughing at?$ Well, April, I'm not going back to my ship.$ Why

about that.$ She'll love it out in the country.$ My folks will be crazy about her.$ Well, that's that, I suppose.$ I'm glad.$ I never wanted April to be in show business.$ My baby angel.$ What's the next thing on the program?$ Why, I thought we all might all have dinner some place to celebrate.$ Where?$ You gotta make it early.$ I have a show.$ How about that chop suey place we was at the other night?$ That's fine.$ Okay, about six?$ Great.$ Well, I'll be running along.$ Goodbye for a little while, sweetheart.$ Oh, excuse me.$ You're all right, son.$ Was that the boyfreind we've been hearing

star.$ Now, I ask you, Tony... what girl wouldn't grab at the chance to land on Broadway in a big show?$ None, I suppose.Not since you're locked to them.$ Let's pray it ended up with nothing to be locked with right now.$ Tony, don't look at me like that.$ Makes me feel terrible.$ I really think you're an awfully sweet boy, but after all, when it comes to love, why, I've only known you five

Any news Frank?$ - Alice, lock that door.$ As you were saying... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner, uh, died last night.$ On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate.For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.$ Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me.$ That won't get you anywhere.$ -

P.S.$ Aunt Fanny had an eight-pound boy.$ Can you come to the wedding?"$ You see, everything is all right, boys.$ Everything is all right.$ You're all invited to the wedding of Aunt Fanny's eight-pound boy.Hooray!$ Oh, but that won't be for a couple of years yet.$ In the meantime, I want you to buck up, get down to work.$ Let's put this thing over with a bang.$ And above all, forget about money.$ Don't think of it.$ Just forget about it, because you won't get it anyway.$ Hooray.$ Hooray.Hooray!$ I keep them dancing for their money.$ Jamison, I'm going down to meet the 4: 15.$ If I never come back, you'll know I'm still waiting for the train.$ Yes, sir.$ And in my absence, I'm relying on you to take good care of everything.$ You can depend upon me, sir.$ That's fine.$ If any guests come in, take good care of them.$ And think of me, Jamison.$ You bet I will.$ I'll be back someday.$ All right.$ Keep a light burning in the window, if you can find a window.$ All right, sir.$ Good-bye.$ Good-bye, Jamison.$ Hello, Harvey.$ Why so downhearted?$ Is Bob Adams cutting you out with Polly Potter?$ I'm not worried about a hotel clerk.$ No, but I'll bet you're worried about the Potter millions.$ You generally could use money in the old days.$ Oh, lay off that stuff.$ You know, marrying Polly is the only way for you to square your debts.$ I can take care of myself.$ I doubt it.$ Suppose I have a little plan that'll take care of both of us.$ Have you ever seen that diamond necklace of Mrs. Potter's?$ You bet I have.$ What's that got to do with us?$ Her room and my room are right next to each other.$ Hers is 318; mine, 320.$ The door between is unlocked.$ She keeps everything in a jewel case locked up in her dresser.$ The key is always in her bag.$ That's what you've got to get.$ It's a large order, but maybe it can be done.$ Suppose I invite Mrs. Potter and Polly to take supper with me tonight?$ What then?$ Sometime during the evening...I might be able to get the key out of her bag.$ Now you're talking.$ That sounds more like old times.$ And now I will try and get rid of Bob Adams for you.$ Look, this is Cocoanut Manor.$ You know that hill?$ What a question.$ Do I know that cunning little hill?$ It's cunning, all right.$ But that's why there hasn't been any development here.$ Couldn't it be cut down?$ Too expensive.$ Now, here's what happened.$ John W. Berryman was here to see it last month.$ You know, Berryman practically built Palm Beach and Miami, but he said he wouldn't touch this.$ Now when a man like that passes a place up, no one wants it.$ Do you know anything about architecture?$ No, but I'd love to learn.$ Well, I made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills.$ It's a built-up scheme, without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way.$ I made the hill fit in with the architectural scheme.$ I sent Berryman a copy last week, and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans.$ That's thrilling.$ Does Mr. Hammer know about it?$ Not yet.$ But if he takes it, I'll design the buildings.$ Say, I may be an architect yet.$ If he only does, I'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world.$ It would be...$ if you lived there.$ Look, see what I've written?$ " Heaven for Polly and me."$ That looks great.$ When do I move in?$ Any day now.$ It's a lovely dream, Bob.$ Let's make it come

practical kind$ And I'll be there$ With you$ When my dreams$ Come$ True$ Will you look at that?$ I am looking.$ Well, it's darn cute.$ I wonder who it can be.$ Then little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf," Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf."$ Hello.$ How do you do, Miss Potter?$ Hello.$ Hello.$ Your mother is looking for you, Polly.$ She generally is, and she generally finds me.$ You know Mother.$ Thanks a lot.$ It was a lovely story, Mr. Adams.$ I'd like to hear the rest of it sometime.$ Good-bye.$ I wonder if I could hear it sometime.$ With pleasure.$ How about you, Yates?$ No, thanks.You know what

what he wants.$ Not always.$ I might win out yet.$ Well, miracles do happen.$ Well, Polly, you've been out again with Mr. Adams.$ But only for a little while, Mother.$ Why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk... when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the Boston Yates... is more than I can understand,$ Oh, who cares about the Boston Yates?$ Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk.$ He's an architect.$ He's only clerking until he can get started.$ One who clerks, Polly, is a clerk, and that settles it.$ And I want you to remember that no Potter... has ever been involved in a single scandal.$ How about Uncle Dick?$ Polly, it's a well-known fact... that your uncle was drunk at the time.$ And another thing, young lady, I'm quite tired of your sitting out on the beach... all hours of the night.$ Hey.Why don't you take something for that insomnia?$ You ought to cut out drinking so much coffee.$ I'm sorry, sir.$ Say, any luck with the 4: 30?$ Yes, it didn't hit me.$ That's the only luck I had with it.$ Mr. Hammer, I think I know what's wrong with the hotel.$ I think I know too.$ You're fired.$ Get your hat and my coat and get out.$ Maybe the season hasn't started yet.$ Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.$ Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.$ In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.$ Yes, and making the beds.$ Go on, get out of here.$ I can handle this rush myself.$ 600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here.$ How do you do, Mr. Hammer?$ Why don't you whistle at the crossing?$ You're just the woman I'm looking for.$ Now whether you like it or not, I'm gonna tell you about Florida real estate.$ It's the first time it's ever been mentioned down here, today.$ Do you know that property values have increased 1929 since 1,000%?$ Do you know that this is the biggest development since Sophie Tucker?$ Do you know that Florida is the show spot of America and Cocoanut Beach is the black spot of Florida?$ You told me about this yesterday.$ I know, but I left out a comma.Look.$ In a little while we're gonna hold an auction sale at Cocoanut Manor, the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.$ You must come over.$ There's gonna be entertainment, sandwiches and the auction.$ If you don't like auctions, we can play contract.$ Here it is.$ Cocoanut Manor, 42 hours from Times Square by railroad.$ 1,600 miles as the crow flies, 1,800 as the horseflies.$ There you are, Cocoanut Manor glorifying the American sewer and the Florida sucker.$ Why, it's the most exclusive residential district in Florida.$ Nobody lives there.$ And the climate...$ Ask me about the climate, I dare you.$ Very well.How...$ I'm glad you brought it up.$ Our motto is, Cocoanut Beach... no snow, no ice and no business.$ Do you know that Florida is the greatest state in the Union?$ Is it?Take its climate.$ No, we took that.$ Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.$ Take all the alligator pears and keep' em.$ See if I care.$ Do you know how alligator pears are made?$ Haven't the slightest idea.$ That's because you've never been an alligator, and don't let it happen again.$ Do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together?$ They don't like each other.$ No.No.Do you know how many alligator pears are sent out of this state every year and told not to come back?$ I don't think I do.$ All they can get a hold of.$ Florida feeds the nation, but nobody feeds me and that's what I wanna talk to you about.Mr. Hammer...$ Another thing, take our cattle raising.$ I don't mean anything personal.$ But here is the ideal cattle raising section.$ We have longhorns, shorthorns and shoehorns.$ Mr. Hammer, will you let me say something, please?$ I hardly think so, and there's something else I wanna bring to your mind.$ Where will you be when you're 65?$ That's only about three months from now.$ If I were to buy, I should prefer someplace like Palm Beach.$ Palm Beach?$ The Atlantic City of yesterday?$ The slums of tomorrow?$ Do you know that the population of Cocoanut Beach has doubled in the past week?$ Has it?Three bulldogs were born.$ We're expecting a nanny goat in the morning.$ I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I must be going.$ Aw, now, don't go.$ Before you go, let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we're gonna lay.$ Look at it.Nobody could fool you on a sewer pipe, can they, a woman like you?$ Now this is the eight-inch pipe.$ But of course, all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe.$ In case of a tie, it goes to the Supreme Court, and I can give you a little inside information in advance.$ The chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer.$ Here, put it in your pocket.$ I'll see you later.$ Mr. Hammer, I can't use this.$ I don't want it.$ Hello.Yes?$ Ice water in 318?$ Is that so?$ Where'd you get it?$ Oh, you want some?$ Oh, that's different.$ Have you got any ice?$ No, I haven't.$ This is Cocoanut Beach...$ no snow, no ice.$ Get some onions.$ That'll make your eyes

You know my brother David.$ Yes.$ Hello, Dave.$ How do you do?$ Howdy, DOV!$ Hello, Zeke.$ Howdy, Bill.$ Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you about this here boy Coleman.$ He can heave a knife into a mark so big every time.$ I'll bet you a buffalo hide he can't heave it into that post back of ya.$ Call the bet!$ Now here.Show him, boy.$ Bless our wild heart!$ Oh, I've seen him do it a hundred times, eh, Bill?$ That's another buffalo hide you owe me, Jack.$ You remember, Bill, that time up, uh, on the Snake River...$ Oh, I sure do.$ Say, boy, I want to know about old Ben Griswell.$ I hear the Indians downed him.$ Only it wasn't Injuns downed him.$ Renegade whites done it.How come?$ He'd been wolf in' all winter.$ Yeah?$ Must've had $ 2,000, $ 3,000 worth of wolf pelts.$ Oh, easy that.$ He was hacked up and stuck full of arrows.$ Looked like Injun work, all right.$ The wolf pelts was gone.$ If ever I find them hellhounds,I'll sure make' em hunt their holes.$ Lopez, who's that young buck over there with no hair on his face?$ That's, uh, Breck Coleman.$ He very quick with his knife.$ Oh, where's he come from?$ He come from the plains, the mountains.$ He live with the Indians.$ He can throw a knife through the heart in 20 feet.$ He's the best shot in all this country.$ He knows everything.$ He'll know too much for his own good someday.$ All right.$ If old Ben had lived, he'd be going on about 72 now, wouldn't he?$ Injuns never done this.$ It was renegade whites.$ And they've left their mark.$ Say, Zeke, who was that he-grizzly that just went by?$ Why, that's Red Flack.$ He's bullwhackin' for Wellmore.He's gonna whack Wellmore's train clear through to Oregon.$ You reckon you'll ever find out who downed old Ben?$ It's just possible that a certain low-down coyote left his sign there.$ Well, hello, Coleman.$ Howdy, Wellmore.$ I've changed my mind.$ I'll scout for that bull train after all.$ Well, that's a ray of sunshine.$ Shake hands afore you change your mind again.$ Got a good wagon boss for the trip?$ Red Flack.A burly ruffian, but he can maul the toughest traitor on the plains into a pulp without even working up a sweat.$ He can do that, eh?Flack?$ Ha!Why, he likes to do it.$ But he can run a bull train.$ Here he comes now.$ Well, Wellmore, all ready to start?$ Likely you two have met before.$ I reckon not.$ Coleman's gonna scout for the train.$ You understand, Flack, that he's to have final say in all matters dealing with the Indians.$ Yes?$ Well, who's got the final say about bossing' this bull train?$ He understands that you're the wagon boss.$ Yeah.Another thing, another thing...$ Am I supposed to be wet nurse to them woodenhead pilgrims a-crossin' the plains?$ The more that goes along, the better it is for them and you in case Indians jump ya.$ Well, all right.All right!$ Make it clear to him that I'm wagon boss.$ Oh, he understands that, Flack.$ He seems to be a right pleasant cuss.$ He's a ruffian, but he's a real wagon boss.$ Likely he is.$ Must've done a big trade in wolf pelts this year.$ Yes, we had a big trade with the wolfers.$ Flack sell you any of these?$ Flack?$ No.He didn't do any wolfing last winter, I guess.$ What outfit did you buy the biggest bunch from?$ Fella name of Lopez come in about a month ago with close on to 5,000 dollars' worth.$ Lopez, eh?$ I guess I don't know him.$ I signed him up as a bullwhacker on the train.$ You did, eh?$ I'll see you next year.$ Bring your scalp along back whole.$ All right.Good-bye.$ Is that so?$ It certainly is.$ I don't know whether they're gonna get through or not...$ Windy, I'm gonna scout for that bull train.$ Good.$ Oh, Mr. Cameron, this is Mr. Coleman.$ Howdy, Mr. Coleman.$ How do you do, sir?$ Uh, he can tell you more about that country where you're going, and what kind of an outfit you need than any man around here.$ Thanks.$ Windy, throw my bags in with yours and Zeke's, will ya?$ All right, I'll do.$ Tell Zeke I'm going along.$ All right, boy.$ Mr. Coleman, would you mind looking over my outfit?$ Certainly not.$ Uh, we'll go have a peek at it.$ Where is it?$ Right over there, sir.$ Honey Girl, it's time for your history lesson, dear.$ Now, uh, how many stars in the flag?Twenty-six.$ How many stripes?$ Thirty.$ Now, you know better than that.$ There's 13.$ And what do they stand for?$ The 13 original colonies.$ Now remember that.$ Now, who discovered the Columbia River?$ Here's our outfit.$ Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.$ Robert Gray.$ Honey Girl, it isn't safe to be sitting in a rocking chair, when there are certain persons present.$ I think you'll find we have everything.$ Plenty of guns?$ A rifle and a fowling piece.$ How about ammunition?Plenty.$ One thing...I don't see any barrel.$ A barrel?$ Yeah, you'll need a water barrel.$ There'll be long stretches without water.$ I knew we'd forget something.$ I'll go get one.$ All right.$ What I was aiming to tell you was this.$ When I came in...$ The folks right next there had an extra one.$ Oh, quick work, son.$ Say, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take two barrels.$ Suppose you go rustle another one.$ I'll do that.$ When I came romping into the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...$ How's this one?Oh!$ Well, that's fine.$ Looks like barrels grow on trees around here.$ Mr. Cameron, you better tell your sister to change that pretty dress.$ She won't get very far in that.$ Yes, sir.$ Put on some traveling clothes.$ Let's have a peek around here.$ We have a trailer, in case we needed...$ I like him better than Mr. Thorpe.$ Honey Girl, we'll finish your history lesson.$ Ah, I know how that is.$ Well, you won't...$ Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie Bell and make yourself scarce.$ If you're here when the boat pulls out, the boys will certainly lead your pony out from under you.$ Why, I had no intention of staying.$ I'll be on the Peensie Bell when she leaves.$ You see that you are.$ My goodness.$ I don't know what I'm going to do with you.$ Well, I try again.$ Come on.$ Here.$ Oh, you stubborn jackass.$ I give you a" yab" in the" yaw."$ I bet you" yump."

him up?$ I don't know.$ I pull and I pull, but he won't come up.$ Wait.Wait.$ I got an idea.$ Say, what did you say to him then?Heh!$ I told him a joke about my mother-in-law.$ Gus!Wait.$ Shh.Here she comes.$ Gus, what have you got there?$ This is my new horse.$ I just bought him.$ You bought him?$ Sure.$ Say, ya...$ That wasn't me, Mama.$ No, it was the mule.$ That rum's for you and me, eh?Ah, gracias.$ Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?$ I always thought you was hung and planted years back.$ No, my time ain't arrived yet, Flack.$ Yeah.Though it looks as though it might be drawing close.$ Ah, how come?$ Well, I've been promised a hanging bee if I don't get out on the Peensie Bell.And the captain promised me a necktie party if I set foot on the boat.$ It appears to me you do your shooting by daylight, with too many people looking on, eh?It's a case of nowhere to go.$ Yeah.$ Well, long as you can't go and you can't stay, just what do you figure to do about it, eh?$ Well, I've always been able to wiggle out.$ Yeah.Appears to me as if you was born to be drowned, eh?$ Come on, Zeke.$ Get rid of that moonshine, and let's get out in the sunshine.$ All right, big boy.$ Hold your head up.$ Don't leave me.$ Yeah, so long, folks.$ See you next year.$ Are you just as handy with a gun as you was?$ I can drive a nail at 30 paces.$ Well, as long as you can't go, and you can't stay...Wouldn't be a bad idea if you was to go along with me.$ Well, that sounds reasonable.Yeah.$ Where do you happen to be headed for?$ Well, anyways, it's out there, where there ain't no noose awaiting' for you, eh?$ Hello, Breck.$ Well, Windy, I trapped him with his jug down at Joe's.$ Hey, Windy, here's the last you'll see of civilization for a long time.$ That's worth tryin'.Hey!Back up here, will ya?$ Back up.I gotta finish that with Windy.$ Hey, that's what you get for not drinkin' with me.$ I'll drink at your next wedding.$ Windy, uh...$ Do some of them musical things, will you, with your mouth?$ Ah, that's old stuff.$ Dab, no.$ Something new.$ Oh, well.$ A coyote.$ That's no coyote.$ There's the stuff!Hey!$ Hey, did you ever kill a dead Indian?$ No, I never killed a dead one.$ Before they was dead, did ya?$ No.You see, the Injuns are my friends.$ They taught me all I know about the woods.$ They taught me how to follow a trail by watching the leaves.And how to cut your mark on a tree so you won't get lost in the forest.And they taught me how to burry in in the snow, so you won't freeze to death in the storms.$ And they taught me how to make a fire without even a flint.$ And they taught me how to make the best bow and arrows too.$ Did they teach you how to make papooses?$ No, that's one of their own secrets.$ Well, boys, I guess we better get going.$ O God, our Father, as you sit on high and look down on us poor mortals, forgive our frailties.$ I am about to lead these people into a wild and dangerous country.$ Give me strength and wisdom, 0 God, to lead them through.$ Where's my steps?$ Mama, I got everything packed up in the wagon.$ But how can I get into the wagon, you idiot?$ Well, look, I show you.$ Look, Mama, put your feets up on there.$ That's

squawker somewheres afore.$ Can't recollect just where.$ He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty look at you once in a while, boy.$ We had a run-in the first day.$ Yeah?$ You know, he ain't no settler.Nah.$ And he ain't no bullwhacker.Uh-uh.$ Wonder what he come along for.Aha!$ He come along, uh,' cause of that, uh, Cameron girl.$ I'm still mystified, Mr. Thorpe, why you came here instead of returning to your plantation.$ I've told you why I came.$ I induced Captain Hollister, an old friend of mine, to put back to shore, and I followed you.$ Yes, I know that's what you told me.But I'm afraid you're a flatterer.$ Oh!On my honor, no.$ You got a chew of tobacco?$ Hey, Lopez!$ Tobacco's gonna be mighty scarce later on.$ Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy Bill and get a slug of" come on."$ Your name's Lopez, eh?$ Uh, Lopez, that's me.$ You and Flack good friends, he tells me.$ Ah, Flack and me been friends 12, 15 years.$ You were out wolfing together last winter, eh?$ No, no, no.Wolfing, she not good business.$ No money.$ Then you didn't get many?$ No, not much.$ Wellmore said you sold him more furs than any other half dozen outfits.$ No.He must have been talking about someone else.$ Not me.$ Well, no matter.$ See you often.$ Ah, you rascal.$ Got a good bunch of bullwhackers, Flack.$ That, uh, Lopez strikes me as a good hand.$ Ah, you bet.$ Lopez can pound them along.$ You and him old friends, eh?$ Who?$ Lopez and me?$ Nah.I never see'd him till he signed on this trip.$ My mistake.$ I don't like this man Coleman.Yeah?$ If he asks after me, you tell him you never see'd me, till you signed on this trip.$ You're too late.$ Why?$ He just speak to me, and I tell him we was old friends.$ What?$ What do you use under your hat instead of brains?$ You need no brains if you got this.$ Ahh.Now you're talking sense.$ Pick your partner and a-promenade back.$ First couple out to the right and follow the ca...$ First couple out to the right and follow the call.Maybe she won't, uh, talk with him, but she'll dance with him, eh?$ It's a lovely dance.$ On with the next and follow the call.And a lovely night.$ And a lovely girl.$ Now's your chance.$ Go in and snag her away from him.$ I claim the favor.$ With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.$ Well, Zeke.$ Hello, boy.$ Thorpe just stole my partner and left me dancing with myself.$ Yeah?$ Say, boy, it just come to me a minute ago, where I seen that there Thorpe before.$ Where?$ Camped on the Cimarron with Flack and Lopez.$ They're old friends.$ Are you sure of that?$ Dead certain.So keep your eye peeled on him, son.$ Oh, I'm tired.$ I think I'll go to my wagon.$ Why, certainly.$ Let me take you there.$ And to think this same moon is shining on my old plantation in Louisiana.$ All it needs is a lovely woman to preside there.$ Someday you'll find her.$ I have found her, Ruth.$ Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.Look, I've told you before that there can be no happiness without love.$ But love will come.$ Ruth...I'm really tired, Mr. Thorpe.$ Do you mind if I go to bed?$ Good night.$ We're getting into dangerous country, Flack...$ So I'll be riding to the Pawnee villages to pick up some Injun scouts.$ Yes?$ Well, you're likely to lose your scalp out there.$ I'll bet you a couple of wolf pelts I bring it back with me.$ How long'll you be gone, Coleman?$ Three or four days, a week maybe.$ Oh, back so soon?$ I thought maybe you wouldn't be coming back at all.$ And just why did you think that?$ Well, after I sort of took the dark-eyed beauty away from you,I thought you might be decamping.$ Listen, Thorpe.$ I never quit a job in the middle of the road.$ Oh, quite so.Quite so.$ But after the girl quit you in the middle of the road...$ Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!$ I know who you are now, and I know why you quit the Cimarron country too.$ No necessity to have quarrels among friends.$ Friends?$ You threw too wide a loop.$ Remember this, the three of you...$ I'm not your friend.$ Well, you let him scare you stiff.$ Not at all.$ Only an idiot, you know, presses a quarrel, when the other man has a knife pressed against his middle.$ Yeah.Good excuse.$ Wolf pelts, eh?$ What does that mean?$ Don't mean nothin'.$ It doesn't to me, but it does to you.$ Yeah?Where'd you get that notion?$ When he mentioned wolf pelts, you looked as though he'd rammed a knife in you.$ Not exactly what I'd call a poker face.Yeah?$ Well, what of it?$ Oh, nothing.$ Only I'm beginning to understand why you don't like Coleman.$ Bye, Windy.$ And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the happy hunting grounds if not before.$ Good luck, boy.$ Bye.$ Well, Miss Ruth, I got some good news for you.$ What?$ I'm gonna be away for a while.$ I'm going scouting'.$ Well, isn't that dangerous in the open country?$ Lord, no.I love it...$ Especially now that it's spring and everything's so happy.$ Why, there's trees out there, big, tall pines...Just a-reachin' and a-reachin'...As if they wanted to climb right through the gates of heaven.$ And there's brooks, too, with the water smiling all day long.$ But the part I like best is the night...$ Lying out there beneath a blanket of stars, with that old moon smiling down on you.$ And every time you look up, there she is, sort of guarding over you, like a mother minding her young.$ Sometimes it's so beautiful that I just lie there, listening.$ Birds singing, brooks laughing, and the wind sort of crooning through the forest.Like some great organ.$ Oh, I've always loved it.$ But I reckon I'm gonna be lonely this time.$ You know, you can get sort of used to having somebody not like you.And when they're not around, you miss them not liking you.$ That's why I reckon I'm gonna be lonesome.$ But I'll be thinking of you.$ Good-bye.$ And you just take care you don't lose your scalp!$ Zeke, is he leaving the train?$ Yes, miss.$ He's riding out to Pawnee villages.$ Well, how far are they?$ Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.$ Well, isn't that dangerous?$ Well, he's likely to lose his scalp afore he gets there.$ But once in the villages, he's safe.So don't you worry about him, miss.$ What...$ Why should I worry about him?I don't know, miss.$ I don't know.$ But seemed like as if maybe you was.$ Oh, not at all.He means nothing to me.$ No.$ No, in course not.$ Good night.$ Good night, Zeke.$ Hey!You got back here at last, eh?$ Yeah.$ There's plenty of buffalo sign out here, so I'll be riding out to pick up fresh meat.$ Ah, well, who's keeping you?$ I'll see you at the river crossing.$ Thorpe!Pull up here.Come here.$ You two have been waiting for your chance.$ Here it is.$ Go out on a buffalo hunt.$ Me?Nah.$ I kill hundreds of buffalo.$ Why should I go?$ Ah!Get them cobwebs out of your brain!$ He means, Lopez, we might find better game.$ Watch him till he leaves the Pawnees, and then give it to him in the back.$ Hey, you pilgrims!$ Come here!Come here!$ Bascom?Yes!$ Bascom!$ Yes.I'll shove the horses and the cattle right on through.$ Leave only the wheelers hooked to the wagons.$ Once you take to the water...Well, it's every man and critter for hisself, eh?$ Get out of here!$ Get out of here!Go on!$ Mr. Flack.$ Mr. Flack, how can I get my mule Useless across?$ Well, uh, get your mother-in-law to ride him, eh?$ Mr. Bascom.Yes?$ Mr. Bascom, you know, I don't like that fella.No?$ He's the kind who will pat you on your back to your face, and then laughs in your face behind your back.Yeah.$ And another thing.$ Yes?If he had a mother-in-law like mine, he would never laugh.$ The hunt was a great success.$ We bagged our buffalo.$ Did you get your meat, eh?$ Ah, good.Good!$ Well, we'd better shove on off then.$ I see you took a bath.$ Is there...ls there a slug of whiskey?$ No, I left my jug...I hid it in the Camerons' wagon.$ By the way, where is my little beauty?$ Well, she's, uh...She's somewheres around.$ Well, now that you've got her all to yourself, what do you aim to do with her?$ I think I'll take her back and settle on my plantation.$ Your...Your plantation, eh?$ Lopez, he's hollered so much about that there plantation of his, he believes it hisself, eh?$ What?The Señor Thorpe, he have no plantation?$ Plantation!Ha!$ All you got in the world is a dirty deck of cards and a crooked one at that.$ Yeah?Coleman's been gone two days.$ Yeah.I've been kinda worried about that myself.$ Eagle Tail says last time he seen him, he was headed for the train.$ Well, another thing, the Camerons haven't crossed yet.$ No.$ I better saunter on down there and see what's holdin'' em, huh?$ Yes.We'd better help' em across.$ Well, I think we can...$ We were just wondering what had become of you.$ Where's your horse?$ He stepped in a prairie-dog hole and broke his neck.$ Come near breaking' mine too.$ Are you hurt?$ No.I was knocked out for a spell.$ Here, I'll put these in your wagon and help you across.$ Flack said we could only use the wheelers.$ Flack said?$ What does he know about water?$ He never took a bath in his life.$ Shortie!$ There's the Cameron wagon.$ I'll go greet the little filly.$ Greet, eh?$ Well, Lopez and me will go greet a jug.$ Whoa!You take' em from here on in, Dave.$ It's shallow water.All right, Breck.$ I'll go back and get my saddle.$ All right.$ Giddyap!$ Come on, Shortie!$ Come on!$ I was just coming over to help you.$ Thank you.We had the best of help.$ Help?$ Who?$ What's the matter, Lopez?$ Seein' a few ghosts?$ Me?$ No, no.$ Drive on into the corral, Dave.$ All right.$ Giddyap!$ Come on there!$ Get up there!$ I'll be seeing you three later about matters and things.$ Why, hello, boy.$ Howdy, Zeke.$ Why, what happened?$ I suppose a prairie dog shot that hole through your saddle and into your horse, eh?Pony stepped in a dog hole.Yeah?$ Natchie!$ Who was gone from camp, Zeke?$ Thorpe and Lopez come in during the night, and early morning, sent a wagon out for the meat.$ Well, a nice mess you made of things.$ Not at all!$ Two hundred yards running is considerable of a handicap.$ Besides, other days are coming.$ Well, don't you fool yourself.$ Here he is, here he is, here he is.$ Flack, the Injuns been sending up smoke signals for several days.$ Yes, well, I seen' em.$ I'll skirmish around with the Pawnees for a few miles.$ Well, go on.There ain't no one keeping you!$ No, but you'd better keep Thorpe and Lopez here.$ Why?$ I got a feeling that if either one of' em leaves camp, they'll never come back.$ What do you mean by that?$ Just the way it sounded.$ Hey, look there.Look there, eh?$ Injuns?$ Lopez, fire a long shot at' em.$ No fire!$ They're Cheyennes.$ They want to palaver.$ Ah, they look to me as if they're out for harm.$ They will be if we take a shot at' em.$ That'll mean war.$ I'll go out and palaver with them.$ Go on.Go on.$ Maybe so you no come back, huh?$ Look how queerly his horse is acting.Yeah.$ He's riding zigzag.$ That's Indian sign that he wants to palaver.$ There's the chief riding out to meet him now for a powwow.$ Zeke!$ Bascom!$ This is Black Elk, an old friend of mine.$ Do they mean peace or war?$ Peace, if as long as we march straight through the Cheyenne country without stopping to settle.$ Now that we're gonna be friends, they'll probably bring their families over here to beg.So feed' em well and treat' em right, and we'll have no trouble.$ Yes.$ Yes.Zeke, what's he saying about me?$ He says that Coleman wants you for his squaw.$ And he says Flack or Thorpe will get you.$ Flack or Thorpe?$ Why?$ Yeah.Well, Flack's got a lot of horses.$ Miss Ruth, you shouldn't be riding out here alone like this away from the train.$ Why not?$ Because this is dangerous country and anything might happen.$ You wouldn't care.$ Care?Me?$ Why should you care?$ Listen, girl, if anything happened to you, it'd be like throwing my heart to the wol...$ Don't worry.It's Black Elk and some of his braves.$ Coleman squaw.Coleman squaw.$ Well, he's saying that I'm your squaw.$ Seems like that's what he's driving at.$ Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw.$ I've never told Black Elk a lie yet.$ He knows my tongue is straight.$ Well, what do you mean?$ Well, it wouldn't be true if I told him I didn't want you.$ It happens I do.$ And you've no better taste than to tell me that before all these savages?$ I'd tell you that in front of the whole world.$ This silly joke has gone far enough.$ Well, there's one down anyway.$ Well, there's some more out there.$ Let's go get' em.All right, here we go.$ Here she goes!$ That's it.That's it.$ Another one.$ All right.$ Hold tight.$ Ah, you should be fine.$ Hang on, boy.$ You take Honey Girl from here on down, Dave.$ It's a little easier going.Hold on.All right, Breck.$ Careful of her, Davey.$ Now, Miss Ruth, you cling on to me.$ Put your arms around my neck, Honey Girl.$ A little tighter.$ Just a little tighter.$ Are you all right, Honey Girl?$ It was a pretty bad place, wasn't it, Breck?$ Yeah, but I sort of liked it.$ Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.Come on, Honey Girl.$ Thank you, Breck.$ Well, well, well, well!$ So I've seen that gal with her arms around your neck at last.$ Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them when she got on safe footing'.$ You know, she don't care nothin' about me, Zeke.$ Well, you can never tell how a woman feels by the way she acts.$ They's all riddles, all of' em, and you just gotta guess' em.$ And no matter which way you guess, you're wrong.$ Looks like as if the way they're puttin' some of them outfits over there, they're a-gonna lose' em.$ What did I tell you?$ Let's get out of here afore they get a bead on us.$ Zeke, did you hear that terrible crash?$ Hear it?I seen it.$ You did?That was your wagon!$ Oh.Was my mother-in-law in it?No, she wasn't.$ Oh, that's too bad.$ What'd you say?$ I said," I am glad."$

Flack.How long are we gonna camp here?$ Well, just as long as it takes to fix up the outfit.$ Bascom, you tell them pilgrims of yours, there's 500 miles of desert ahead of us and them that don't like what's comin' to them, now's the time for'em to turn back.$ Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now.$ Shank me off a snack!$ Get out of there.$ Fine piece of beef.$ Fetch it on over here.$ I hate to see you at menial tasks.$ If we were only back at my old plantation in Louisiana, you'd have a dozen servants to wait on you.$ Let's turn back.$ Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?$ Why, I...$ Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell you to stay away from the fire?$ And you told me not to be sitting in a rocking chair when Breck Coleman was around.$ Hello, Coleman.$ Howdy, Dave.$ You shot these turkeys.$ Won't you stay and help us eat them?$ No.$ Uh, I just had supper with the Bascoms.$ Sorry, Breck.$ Think I'll go hunt up old Zeke.$ How many's that for you, Windy?$ Number 84.$ Well, here comes 85.$ Hello, Zeke.$ Windy.$ Hello, boy.$ I smell turkey a-cookin'.$ That's all I got was a smell.$ Deal me a hand of them flapjacks.$ That's the way it's done, Gussie.$ My old arm's giving out.$ Now you try it.$ I'll get a pail of water.$ That's easy.$ I can do that.$ See, I've saw Zeke do that till he broke his arm.$ Yes.And you know, someday my mother-in-law's gonna talk so much, she's going to break her" yaw."$ Say, boy, I wouldn't let my mother-in-law boss me around like that.$ Stand up to her like a man.$ Face her down, boy.Huh.$ If it was me, I'd tell her what was on my chest.$ You got nothing on your chest but wind!$ You old polecat.$ I've just been talking with some trappers who've come out of the Southwest.$ They say the country they call California is wonderful.$ Yes, so I've heard.$ Why won't you come with me to a land like that?$ Are you going there?$ If you'll come with me.$ Well, what about your plantation in Louisiana?$ Well...If we like California better, we could sell my holdings and buy vast lands out there.$ Well, it's...It's a compliment to offer me all that, but it can't be.$ I must join Davey.$ Oh, Dave.$ Dave, come over here.$ Black Elk here says that you and your sister were so good to him, when he come in to visit that he wants to give you all them ponies.$ Well, that's kind of him, Zeke, but we couldn't take their horses.$ Oh, of course you could.$ They got hundreds of ponies.$ He wants you to show him where to put' em.$ You go and throw them ponies in with your herd.$ Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.$ That Injun's buying Cameron's sister for Coleman's squaw.$ Well...Well, why not?$ So Coleman's buying himself a squaw, eh?$ Zeke, you old whiskered Cupid, you!$ I loathe the very sight of you!$ What have I done now?$ You've made me the joke of the plains.$ Me?$ Who else tried to buy me like an Indian squaw?$ You put me to shame before them all.$ Why, girl, you're imagining things.$ Zeke always told me women were damned funny.$ Mr. Thorpe, I've changed my mind.$ I'll go with you to California if you'll go at once.$ At once?$ Why, yes, yes.$ Uh, I'll make preparations immediately.$ This is a fine state of affairs.$ This man Thorpe isn't all he claims to be.$ My mind is made up, Davey, and we're going to California.$ Where's Flack?$ I just came in to tell you good-bye.$ Uh, good-bye?$ Where are you going?$ I'm going to take my outfit and leave you here.$ Uh, your outfit?All you got is one horse and two guns.$ No, the Cameron outfit's mine now.$ Oh, it is, eh?$ Yes, we're going to California, so I'll bid you a fond farewell.$ No, you ain't!No?$ Why do you suppose I grubstaked you for, eh?$ So far, you've been a fizzle.$ One try, one miss.$ Oh, he's no longer in my way.$ Well, he's in mine.$ Well, tear him down yourself.$ Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp.$ Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a...$ Well, why not?$ I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun.$ It's the way he throws that knife.$ But why should I risk it?$ Because you're a dead shot.$ You're a-going to stick.$ You're a-going to prove how good you are, before you leave the fort.$ And if I don't?$ Well, if you don't...I'll tell that little filly there's a wide-open noose waiting' for you in every river town.$ Thorpe, you do your job before you leave the fort.$ Howdy, Henry.$ How's things, Coleman?Just fine.$ Say, Black Elk was telling me that all the Injuns in the West was gathering to keep you all from passing' through.$ So they tell me.$ Black Elk and the Cheyennes are going west to hold a powwow with the Shoshones.$ Yeah, Black Elk tells me that it's almost certain that the Cheyennes will declare war later.$ Likely.$ Old Pete Rubideaux was asking about you a while ago.$ Pete?$ Where is he?$ Camped at the spring yonder with his new squaw.$ I think I'll ramble down and see him.Sure.$ Say, Henry, will you put a new cap nipple on this gun?$ Sure will, boy.$ And a new trigger spring in the pistol.$ All right.I'll leave' em with you while I go see Pete.$ Be ready when you come back.$ We are about to unite this loving and devoted couple in the holy bonds of wedlock.$ Hank Ginnis, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?$ I do.$ Abigail Vance, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?$ She does!$ You recollect how Coleman done told you that if Lopez here, or Thorpe done strayed off into the brush, they weren't likely as how never come back?$ Sure!$ He made some kind of a bluff.$ What of it?$ Well, uh, Thorpe strayed out and he ain't a-never comin' back.$ He's done gone back to his old plantation.$ Well, you won't go to California with Thorpe now.$ Why not?$ He and Coleman just met in the brush, and Coleman shot him.$ Are you sure?$ I heard the shot.And I saw Coleman standing there over him.$ It suits me too.$ So he'll even do murder.$ And so I pronounce you man and wife.$ And may peace and happiness be yours.$ There's been a murder!There's been a murder!$ A murder?Where?$ Where, girl?$ Who?$ Coleman met Mr. Thorpe in the brush and shot him!$ That's a serious accusation, my girl.$ Are you sure?$ My brother saw it.$ Men, we can't have cold-blooded murderers among us.$ There's the man that shot Bill Thorpe down like a dog.$ Lopez, go and get a rope.Get a rope.$ And just who accuses me of killing Thorpe?$ It, uh...$ It was Miss Cameron.$ You, eh?$ So you'd like to see me hang.$ Listen to me, you.$ This boy, Coleman, here just couldn't have killed Thorpe.$ Why not?$ 'Cause he didn't have no guns on him.$ He left his'n with Dutch Henry to be fixed.$ Coleman and Thorpe were at odds with the Cameron girl.$ If it wasn't Coleman, who was it who shot Thorpe?$ Since you're aimin' to know, I'll tell you who done it.$ Who?$ I shot that skunk myself!$ Coleman's a friend of his, men.$ He's lying to save his neck.$ What could Zeke have against a man like Thorpe?$ You want to know that too?$ Yes, I want to know that too!$ Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.$ I was camped out pretty close to you, and I heared that powwow you had with Thorpe.$ Yeah?What are you driving at?$ Just this.$ When a man begins to do a lot of talkin' about hangin', he'd better make pretty sure as to who's gonna decorate the end of the rope.Get my meaning?$ Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.$ It's no affair of mine.$ That's just what I was a-thinkin'.Huh.$ And Coleman ain't gonna do no scouting, while I'm boss of this train.$ I'm leaving him behind.$ Ah, now, we're taking on a new scout.$ Guess again, Flack.$ I started with this outfit, and I'll be with it at the finish.$ Who says so?$ I'm just telling ya.$ I got two reasons.$ One is I told Wellmore I'd scout the train through.$ The other is a little personal business I aim to transact at the end of the trail.$ See if you can figure out what that is, Flack.$ Coleman, the settlers are willing to push on.$ We'll follow you.$ What's this talk about Injuns?$ It's true.$ The Injuns are gathering to the westward to stop us from going through.$ Injuns have never yet prevented our breed of men from travelin' into the setting' sun.$ Go on.Lead the way.$ Well, get your outfits together.$ Never mind what you see or what you hear.$ Red Flack is still boss of the train.$ Get her going!Go on.$ It's no use, men.$ She's all dried up.$ Hey, them settlers is dyin' off like rats.$ We're for moving on.$ Come on, Lopez.$ Boy, they're scattered back all across the desert.$ We gotta gather' em up and shove' em along.$ Old Charlie died, Coleman.$ We raised him from a colt.$ Tough, boy.But we gotta battle it through.$ Giddyap!$

shooting'!$ They're ridin' off.$ When they wheel back on us, reload it up and give it to' em!$ Yes, sir!There they go, boy.There they go.$ I guess we was just a little too much for' em.$ Father, our good friends have perished here at the hands of the savages.$ Open your arms to them and care for our loved ones until we meet again on the other shore.$ Amen.$ Ol' Windy's gone on another trail.$ Windy, you and me was...$ Well, you and me was, uh...$ Oh, my baby!My baby!$ Well, Zeke, I'm gonna trail the Injuns and make sure they go back to their villages.$ So you scout the train ahead, and

got my wagon up to the hub in mud!$ What are you kickin' about?$ I am sitting on my mule.$ But don't worry, Mama.$ I think it's gonna clear up.$ There will be no more rain.Get up!$ Get up!Throw that idiot...Throw that idiot a rope and help him out of there.$ Here, Abbie.$ Here's the water.$ Mama, I got good news for you.$ Ah, you're always bad news to me.$ Get on your long underwear quick.$ Why?$ Well, you're going in the snow up to your...$ Up to your...Your...$ Way up, Mama.$ And hand me out my bear overcoat.$ Well, Useless...You're going someplace you won't want to sit down.$ It's so cold, it'll freeze your hooves off.$ You wait and see.$ Think I'll go say howdy to the Camerons.$ This is my best overcoat.$ Well, I'd hate to see your worst one.Hello, Gus.$ Oh, hello there, Breck.$ I'm certainly glad to see you back again.$ What are you wearing the heavy overcoat for?$ I'm getting all ready for that snow.$ No, we won't be there for days.$ Well, anyway, I'm going to keep warm by the camp.$ Where's the Cameron outfit?$ Oh, we left them four or five days back.$ Left' em?$ Yes.All their horses give out.$ They couldn't go on.$ Fifteen, 20 wagons.$ They all went back to the fort.$ I hated to tell ya, son.$ Zeke, why did you let the Camerons go?$ Ah, not my doin', son.$ Flack knows I savvy Injun sign, so he sends me on ahead to scout.$ And when I come back, they'd all dropped out.$ If Injuns chance on those wagons, they'll kill the lot of' em.$ I'm afeard so, Breck boy.$ The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.You scout' em.$ Yeah.$ I'm going back for the Camerons.$ Good luck, son!$ Giddyap, Jennie!$ Well, Useless...$ Giddyap, Jennie!I don't know who smells the worse, you or me.$ Go ahead there!$ Come on.Here we go again.$ Hello!Hello!$ I felt someway that you'd come.$ I'd have been here a heap sooner if I could've.$ Say, Dave, you'd better out off that trailer and throw everything into one wagon.$ All right.$ I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody and we'll see if we can get out of here.$ After you left, old Zeke told me the truth about some matters.$ Thorpe and Flack and all.$ He did, eh?$ Sorry I was so stupid.$ Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.$ Things did look sort of queer.$ I should have known better.$ Well, we all get off on the wrong trail once in a while.$ We'll make it through all right.$ Well, that's fixed.$ Can I do something, Breck?$ No, I guess not.$ We oughta overtake those settlers in a week or so.$ Here you are, Ruthie.$ We're goin' again, Davey.Heave-ho.$ Pull' er there.Come on.$ Come on there, Shortie.$ What did I tell you, huh?$ You wouldn't listen to me.$ You wouldn't listen to me!$ We're lost!$ There ain't a man here that knows the pass over them hills!$ We're for turning back!$ Wait!$ Wait!$ Follow me and I'll lead you to that valley that Coleman told us about.Coleman, huh?$ He's the only one that knows the way out, and he's deserted us!$ Sure, he quit!If he was here, I'd shoot him down in his tracks.$ Well, Flack, just when you gonna start this shooting'?$ You're just in time, Coleman.$ Did you find the Camerons?$ They're over yonder.What's the trouble here?$ They're all against me.$ They're turning back.$ No, you're not!$ We can't turn back.$ We're blazing a trail that started in England.$ Not even storms of the sea could turn back those first settlers.$ And they carried it on further.$ They blazed it on through the wilderness of Kentucky.$ Famine, hunger, not even massacres could stop them.$ And now we've picked up the trail again, and nothing can stop us!$ Not even the snows of winter nor the peaks of the highest mountains.$ We're building a nation!$ So we've got to suffer.$ No great trail was ever blazed without hardship.$ And you've gotta fight!$ That's life.$ And when you stop fightin', that's death.$ What are you gonna do, lie down and die?$ Not in a thousand years.$ You're going on with me!$ The word is said, and we'll follow you.$ Be ready to start at sunup!$ Well, he's turned up again.$ Yeah, well, he'll down the both of us.$ You've got to get him tonight.$ But they can hear a shot at night.$ Well, they can't hear a knife.$ They all know this knife of mine.$ Well, here's a knife they don't know.$ No, no, no, no.I afraid of that knife.$ I know where you got it.$ Shh, shh, shh, shh!$ It will get us in trouble sure.$ How?$ Because a dead man's knife is bad medicine!$ Here, just stop that drivel.No.$ Take the knife and wait for tonight.$ There he goes.$ Wait until he's bedded down, and then...$ Give me a drink.$ God bless my sister Ruth and my brother Dave, and make me a good girl, and take care of us.$ Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman?$ Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself.$ You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez!$ Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife.$ Well, where'd you find it, boy?$ Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.$ Their having it makes it certain that Flack and Lopez did it.$ No question about it, boy.$ What did they do, Coleman?$ Killed my best friend.$ I been on their trail ever since.$ That's a serious charge.$ If you're sure, we'll call a settlers' meeting in the morning to try' em.$ You can call a settlers' meeting to bury' em.$ What do you mean?$ That I kill my own rats!$ They've jumped camp, Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.$ Breck, you can't leave us here!$ You got to see us through.$ He's right, boy.$ Maybe so, the way you all look at it.$ But those two men killed a man in cold blood, and they've got to pay.$ It's not that I've got hatred in my heart, but that I'm the law out here, that's all.And the law is justice.$ Well, Zeke, I'll see' em to the end of the trail.$ But then I'm picking up a new trail here.$ Get over here!Hah!$ Yonder stands the great white mountain.And down below lies the valley I've told you about.$ Coleman, you have fulfilled our hopes.$ Neighbors!$ Friends!$ It is fitting that we give thanks to the Almighty.$ Our Father, we thank thee for leading us to this land of promise, for guiding our footsteps safely through the dangers of our pilgrimage.$ In this valley of our dreams, we'll build our homes and serve thee, O Father.And our children's children shall praise thy name.$ The way is clear ahead.$ All gentle slopes.$ So drive down, my friends, and settle it.$ Lead the way.$ Zeke will lead the way down.$ Our trails fork here.$ You mean you are leaving us?$ There's a trail I've followed for over 3,000 miles now, and I'm headin' back to pick it up again and follow it to the end.$ Coleman, you're the breed of man that would follow a trail to the end.$ Thanks, Bascom.$ Friends, we'll go on.$ Boy, there's two of' em.$ Bad ones.$ Now, I'm going with you.$ No, Zeke.$ You stay here and look after Ruth and her outfit.$ Breck, you're not leaving.$ Yes, Miss Ruth.I'm pullin' out.$ They say you're going to hunt down Flack and Lopez.$ That's what I aim to do.$ But you can't do this awful thing...$ Take two lives!$ It's frontier justice.$ Don't go, Breck.$ It's a job I've got to finish.$ But don't you see?$ It doesn't matter about them.$ I'm afraid for you.$ They'll kill you!$ You're everything in the world to me, Breck.$ I can't let you go!$ I can't!$ The thing has to be done.$ Someday...Somewhere...Our trails will cross again.$ Now, now.$ Come, come, miss.$ You mustn't be a-carryin' on thataway.$ He's gone.$ He'll never come back.$ Now, now, you just mustn't do this, miss.$ You'll have me a-blubberin' here pretty soon.$ I'm a-tellin' ya that everything is going to be all right.$ When spring comes in that valley, he'll be tracking back again.$ I know that boy.$ I know him.$ Now, come, come.$ Come on, Ruth.$ My legs are froze to the knees.$ I can't get up.$ Yes, looks as if you're done for, Lopez.$ But, Flack, don't go away and leave me, Flack.$ What?Do you think I'm staying here?$ Well, then leave me a blanket!I'm frozen.$ Ah, won't do you no good.$ You'll be froze to death in an hour.$ Flack!It may help me.$ Now get away.Flack!$ Flack, don't let me die alone!$ Stay with me!$ Well, Lopez.It won't be long before you have company.$ Yeah, Milt.$ I got a hankerin' to trail on down into Mexico.$ Old Bill Gillie done told me that them there black-eyed gals is just full of fire.$ Zeke?Yeah?$ Zeke, you're not really leaving us?$ Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out.$ You is all nice and settled now.$ And this here valley is gettin' altogether too civilized for me.$ Whenever I get more than three or four families within a hundred mile of me,I begin to feel kind of crowded.$ That's not why you're going, Zeke.$ Why else, gal?$ Breck has never come back.$ You're going out to look for him.$ Now, wherever that boy Breck Coleman is at, he's a-lookin' out for hisself.$ Now don't you fret about him.$ Did you give away all your little puppies?$ Why are you looking at that dress?$ This is the anniversary of the...The day that the wagon train left from Missouri.$ Last time I had this on,I was sitting in the Riggses' cabin.$ In a rocking chair?$ Yes, Honey Girl.$ In a rocking chair.$ Zeke, I reckon that's a panther.$ Yeah!$ It's a two-legged panther.$ The only kind whatever gimme that Comanche yell as a signal.$ We might just as well start to unpack.$ What, ain't you going?$ No use of going now.$ He's only a bit up in the timber there, and he's a-headed this way.$ Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary?$ Yes, gal, I'll stay.Aw!$ And I just recollected, I got a little present for you.$ Oh, Zeke, what is it?$ Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up.$ Where is it, Zeke?$ I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.$ You'll find it there.$ Thanks, Zeke.$

so, but...$ Hush.$ Compliments of the committee.$ Thanks awfully, Roy.$ Well, has he been properly charming?$ Me?$ More than charming.$ Good for you, Monte.$ Taste?$ She loves me.$ She blisters you.$

lifetime.$ We go to France in two weeks.$ Two weeks?$ Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.$ Is that so?$ Bored?$ Tired.$ Take me home, Monte.$ Home?$ It's not far.$ I've taken a flat in town near

rude.$ Well, come on then.$ Are we here?$ Well, it's number 27.$ Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?$ Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.$ No, I'm not.$ Come see my room.$ I've only had a

strike me blind, it's a hair.$ Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.$ Hello, you chaps.$ Hello, Monte.How goes it?$ Still no news of Harry?$ No.$ Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.$ What do you think, Marryat?$ You saw it happen.$ Is there any chance he got down alive?$ No, I don't think so.$ The searchlights got him.$ We were flying low and they heard us.$ We started to climb, but it was too late.$ Shrapnel began bursting all around him.$ Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.$ It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.$ Trying every way to get clear of those lights.$ Then another burst got him.$ We could hear him screaming...Stop!$ I can't stand it.$ Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.$ You might've got it instead of him.$ Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.$ We'll all get it.$ Isn't there any end to this?$ Oh, shut up.$ You're always whining.$ Shut up yourself.$ Who'll make me?$ I'll make you.$ Sit down, Jack, and be

Jymes.$ Yes, sir?$ Don't let anything hurry you.$ No, sir.$ Drinking again?$ You dirty louse!$ Hey, Baldy.$ The sooner you get shot down, the better.$ Baldy, darling.$ Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.$ Monte!$ What's the matter with you?$ Attention.$ As you were.$ The following officers will report for night patrol.$ Drayton.$ Yes, sir.$ Fuller.$ Here, sir.$ Maloney.Oh, no.$ Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.$ Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.$ Neville.$ Here, sir.$ Monte Rutledge.$ I don't feel very well tonight, sir.$ That's all right, boy.$ None of us feel well.$ But you don't understand.$ I think I do, Rutledge.$ But I say, sir.You don't understand.$ Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.$ I know what's the matter with him.$ He's

That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.$ Murder!$ You know it as well as I do.Yellow, am I?$ You're the ones that are yellow.$ I've got guts to say what I think.$ You're afraid to say it.$ So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.$ You fools!$ You poor, stupid fools.$ Oh, Monte.$ Now, pull yourself together, will ya?$ Stand up, Rutledge!$ I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.$ Sir, he really is ill.$ You're a disgrace to your squadron.$ Go to your quarters.$ Yes, sir.$ Have a cigarette.$ You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?$ Why, of course not.$ You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.$ I wonder.$ Well, stop thinking about it.$ I wish I could.$ Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?$ I'm trying to do my share.$ Of course you are now.$ You...You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.$ Oh, that's rot.I$ - I'm not yellow.I'm not!Oh, now, Monte.$ Come on.$ Pull yourself together.$ Staff Colonel.$ Everybody out.$ Come on, Monte.$ Stand easy.$ Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.$ You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.$ No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.$ That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.$ Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.$ We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.$ We've fixed it up so it'll fly.$ We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.$ There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.$ The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.$ Then when they discover the trick, well, you... you may have a little difficulty in getting back.$ I need two men to fly this plane.$ I'll go, sir.$ Are you sure you wanna go?$ Quite sure, sir.$ Very well.$ I'll go with him, sir.$ Who are these men?$ Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.$ Brothers, eh?$ Dismissed.$ Now, young men,I want you to realize how important this is.$ The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.$ The brigade doesn't know it, but I- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.$ There's too much artillery in front of us.$ If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.$ Hundreds of lives depend on you.$ Do you understand?$ Yes, sir.Yes, sir.$ Now, another thing.$ The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.$ It must return or be destroyed.$ If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.$ Baldy.Oh, Baldy?$ You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.$ You might possibly help them get back.$ By all means.$ Yes, sir.$ You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.$ Report to the field at 3: 00 a. m.Until then, let them do as they please.$ - Yes, sir. 3: 00, you two.$ - Yes, sir.$ Good luck.$ Thank you, sir.$ Thank you, sir.$ - What time is it, Monte?$ - Ten past 9: 00.$ Helen's canteen closes at 10: 00.$ We've just enough time to get there.$ - Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?$ - Why, of course.We're" it" tonight.$ Yeah.$ We're" it" all right.$ Not sorry, are you?$ Oh, let's not talk about it.$ I'm not even gonna think about it until 3: 00.$ What's your program?$ Wine, women and song?$ Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.$ - See you at Grosson's?$ - Either there or at Jacques across the street.$ - Wherever you hear the most noise.$ - Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?$ Oh, I better not.$ Where's Helen?$ She's gone out.$ Was she expecting you?$ Would you care to leave a note?$ Yes, I think I will.$ Pen and ink on the table.$ You'll see that she gets this?$ Oh, yes.$ Thank you.$ Good night.$ Good night.$ Hello.What's up?$ She isn't in.$ That's tough.$ Wanna come along with me?$ Where to?$ Grosson's.$ Righto.$ Your switch on?$ Will you close it a little?$ - Helen.$ - Well, if it isn't old Roy.$ Old solemn Roy himself.$ Sit down, Roy.$ Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.$ - Take your hands off her.$ - Oh, I can't take my hands off.$ You heard what I said.$ Take your hands off her.$ Who asked you to this party anyway?$ Helen, let me take you home.$ Home?$ Who wants to go home?$ I'm having a marvelous time.$ I was until you came in.$ I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.$ Keep your...Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.$ Your girl.You fool.$ I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.$ You're nothing to me.$ Nothing.$ Come on, Roy.$ Let's get out of here.$ Come on.Oh, let's have it out.$ I don't love you.$ I never have.$ I never had any fun with you anyway.$ You and your high ideals.$ You're too good to live.$ You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.$ You make me sick, do you hear?$ Sick.Now, get out here.I hate the sight of you!$ Come on, Roy.$ Let's go across the street.$ Sweet, sweet baby.$ Handsome, big, strong baby.$ Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?$ Hello, chèri.$ Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.$ Forget it.$ Is your friend sick?$ No.He'll be all right.$ Drink up, Roy.$ I still can't believe it.$ You just don't know anything about women.$ They're all the same.$ I've been telling you that for years.$ Maybe you'll believe me now.$ - Oh, Helen's not that sort.$ - It's the war.$ She's changed.$ - You're wrong, Roy.$ War doesn't change people.$ It's...It's like getting drunk.$ It brings out what people really are.$ You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.$ Well, she was.$ I've known it all along.$ You too?Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.$ Don't take it so hard.$ She isn't worth it.$ - I suppose you're right.$ - Of course I'm right.$ Listen, Roy, never love a woman.$ Just make love to her.$ You see, like this.$ Go ahead, Roy.$ Try it.$ That's the way.$ Oh!What you do, baby?$ All wet!$ No, no, no, no!$ Imbecile!$ Voilà.$ Hey, listen, Monte.$ Monte.Go easy.We gotta go up at 3: 00.$ Oh, listen, Roy.$ To hell with this 3: 00 business.$ What do you mean?$ Just that.$ To hell with it.$ Say, you're crazy, Monte.$ We can't get out of it now.$ Oh, why can't we?$ Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.$ You tried it on Helen and what happened?$ You got a kick in the face.$ You can't go through life thinking the way you do.$ People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.$ - It's beginning to look as though you're right.$ - Of course I'm right.$ I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3: 00 business too.$ This is another thing entirely, Monte.$ Why is it?$ They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.$ It's chaps like you that are meat for them.$ All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.$ Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?$ - But we can't get out of it now.$ - Why can't we?$ Listen, tell' em...tell' em the motorcycle broke down.$ Tell' em anything.$ What do you say, Roy?$ Well...$ Come on, old ooo-la-la.$ Oh, no, no, no, chèri.$ Oh, baby.$ Oh, oui, oui, madam.Oh, baby.$ Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.$ You're not going anywhere.$ Yes, I am and so are you.$ Who says I am?Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.$ There's no way out of this and we know it.$ Come on, Monte.$ No, no.$ Let me alone.$ Come on, old ooo-la-la.$ Monte.Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.$ Why, that's desertion, Monte.$ They shoot people for that.$ Come on.$ Let's get out of here.$ Come on.$ Come on.$ I suppose you're right.$ Monte.What a pair of fools we are.$ Let's go.$ Easy, now.$ Easy.$ Look out for the firing pin.$ Righto.$ I got it.$ Contactor.$ Ground speed here.$ Keep this site trained on the target.$ Then pull the release when you hit the stop.Do you understand?$ Don't forget the leveler.$ Good-bye.$ Contactor.$ Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.$ Good luck.Thank you.$ Roy, the depot.$ Roy, look there!$ They've seen us.$ They're coming on.$ For Christ's sake.$ Hey, Roy, look.$ They hit our right motor.$ I got him!$ Look over there.$ It's our squadrons.They're coming!$ Roy, they've gone.$ Jesus.$ Son of a Boche.$ Hey!It's me!$ Hey!$ It's me!$ Goddamn it!$ It's old Baldy.Hey!$ Baldy.$ Hello.$ It's Baldy.$ Look, Roy.$ It's Baldy.$ You see that guy?$ Good boy.$ See that?$ Hey, look.$ He's got him.He's got him.$ They've changed around.$ Our strut's gone.$ That son of a bitch.$ Roy, he got us!$ Roy!$ Go down!$ Go down!$ Go down!$ One more for Baldy!$ No more control?$ Pull her up!$ Oh, my God!$ We're on fire!$ We're burning!$ Roy, get down!$ Do something!$ Ah, so.$ We meet again.$ It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?$ Yes.$ And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?$ - Yes.$ - Very clever.$ It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.$ There are a few questions I must ask you.$ If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.$ To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?$ Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?$ It was our natural target.$ But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?$ You are surprised.$ We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.$ Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?$ Oh, you are stupid not to tell.$ It is nothing.$ For you the war is over, nicht wahr?$ We are friends.$ Listen, if you tell me,I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.$ It's near Munich.$ Far away from all this.$ You will have every comfort.$ And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.$ So, you see?$ It can be easy for you.$ Now, please.$ So, you will not tell?$ Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.$ Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?$ And you know what happens to spies?$ I think you two friends had better talk it over.$ I will give you 15 minutes.$ If you change your mind and tell, good.$ If not, you will be shot.$ Do you think he was bluffing?$ No, he wasn't bluffing.$ He's the man I was to fight that duel with.$ Really?$ Quite a coincidence.$ He's got it in for me.$ Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.$ The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.$ Roy, look.$ Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.$ God, what nerve.$ Roy.Roy, I can't face it.$ I'm going to tell.$ Don't be a fool, Monte.Do you realize what it would mean if we told?$ It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.$ But, Monte, you can't.$ To hell with your heroic stuff.$ I wanna live.$ I'm not gonna be shot down like that.$ I'm going to tell.$ Wait a minute.$ Monte.$ But I...$ Listen.$ Let me go.$ You?$ Yes.$ You're all upset.$ I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.$ I- I'll come with you.$ No.You said he's got it in for you.$ Now, let me do it alone.$ All right.$ Tell the general I'm ready to talk.Good.$ Come.$ So, you have changed your mind?$ My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.$ I'm ready to talk.$ You are very wise.$ Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.$ Wait a minute.$ I'll tell only on one condition.$ Ah, so, a condition.$ If I give this information, my friend will know it.$ Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.$ You leave that to me.$ Why not let me have that satisfaction?$ What do you mean?$ I do not understand.$ One does not kill a friend.$ Friend.$ He's not my friend.$ He stole the girl I love and I hate him.$ Huh.History repeats itself.$ You make rather hard terms.$ I'll tell only on that condition.$ One bullet.$ What if I miss?$ Give me two to make sure.$ No.$ A good soldier will need only one.$ Very well.$ Not so fast.$ He will give you the bullet outside.$ Well?$ I didn't tell, Monte.$ Why?$ What happened?$ Has he changed his mind?$ No.Don't you think you can go through with it now?$ What do you mean?$ Of course we can.$ It won't even hurt.$ It'll all be over in a second.$ We can stand anything for a second.$ No, no, Roy.$ L-I can't do it.$ I'm going to tell.$ Listen, Monte.$ We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.$ Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.$ You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?$ That's not my business.$ I didn't start this war.$ I didn't get them into this mess.$ Let' em take care of themselves.$ They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.$ I wanna live.Live!$ You won't tell, I'll tell.$ Listen, Monte!$ I'll tell!$ I'll tell!$ Let me out!$ I'll tell everything I know.$ The brigade is moving up.$ They're going to attack...$ Don't cry, Roy.$ It was the only thing you could do.$ The brigade, Roy.$ Yes, Monte?$ They'll be all right now, won't they?$ Who's that?$ It's the general.$ You thought we'd tell, didn't you?$ Good old Roy.$ You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.$ Roy.$ Yes?Where are you?$ Don't go away, Roy.$ I'm here, Monte.$ Can't you feel me holding you?$ Hello, Karl.$ Fig eights.$ Cold up here in the night patrol.$ Awful to be in the dark.$ Oh.I'm afraid.$ Look out.$ Look out!We're falling!$ We're going to crash!$ Do something, Roy!$ Quick!$ Quick!$ Quick!$ It's all right, Monte.$ Monte?It's all right.$ Well?$ You heard what my brother said.$ Your brother?$ I'll never tell you anything.$ I'll be with

to do with it?$ I missed this wallet the first time I met Kay.$ This morning I found it on my dresser.$ Does that sound like gold-mining?$ She probably gave it back because there wasn't enough in it.$ I refer you to a chapter in the Bible that says about a...$ It says an Ethahopian, an Othahep... well, anyway, some guy who's full of Ether had to change his color and a leopard always takes off his own spats.$ I know a leopard can't change its spots.$ And there's something in the same book... about people who live in glass bottles, er... houses.$ All the way up, brother.$ Now, my next

couldn't imagine anybody having to work...$ Hey, listen.$ She's a festive girl and I think I'm gonna steal her.$ I thought you said she was dynamite.$ What's dynamite for one fellow is bromide suds to another.$ Oh, boy, you're a fake.$ Okay, I'll remember that.$ Alright, now, Miss Arnold.$ Let's get to work.$ Say, that's a fast worker that pal of yours.$ He wants to date me up.$ Is it all right if I go with him?$ With Standish?$ Certainly.$ Splendid fellow.$ Well, I don't know.$ I thought maybe...$ I didn't know.$ I thought maybe er...$ Yes?$ Oh, it's nothing.$ But there's one thing about him.$ He certainly notices things.$ Don't you notice anything?$ Yes, you're chewing gum again.$ Oh, no.$ Well, now...$ I got a new dress on.$ Oh, so you have.$ It's the one you wanted me to get.$ It is, isn't it?$ Suits you very well too.$ Let me know how much it cost and I'll give you a check for it.$ Oh, no you won't.$ Since when are you buying my clothes?$ And there's another thing I wanna know.$ There are a millions models in this town.$ Why did you have to pick on me for?$ I don't know.$ But that first night when you were asleep... you looked like another woman.$ You were yourself.$ Not like you are now.$ I'm always myself.$ No you're not.$ You're covered up.$ This is the fourth time I've started this picture.$ And you know why?$ 'Cause you're...$ I'm what?$ I don't know what.$ It's like

peace in it.$ He was himself again.$ You see what I mean?$ No.$ All I get out of it is you gotta die to find yourself.$ Not me.$ Nor for $ 2 an hour.$ Want a raise?$ No.$ Well I guess I better quit the lecturing anyhow.$ Come on, let's get back to work and... hope.$ Look through the ceiling.$ You almost had it yesterday.$ You were nicer to me yesterday.$ Hello.$ Oh, hello, mother.$ Tonight?$

small?$ Do I look like a small cup of coffee?$ Non, madame.$ I don't mind telling you, Mr. Standish,$ I'm awfully glad Kay was out when you called tonight.$ Where do you suppose she's gone?$ I know where she went.$ The opera with her boyfriend.$ Are you sure of that?$ Where else would she go?$ One at a time.$ That's her policy.$ I'd play the same system if I could get a man with 6 million dollars.$ Jerry hasn't 6 million kopeks.$ No, but his old man has.$ How do you know that?$ Listen, Mr. Standish, in our flat we ain't got much of a library$ Only two books.$ The phone book and

didn't want me.$ But he's coocoo about you.$ I think he's a great fellow.$ You know, if I were you...$ But you ain't me.$ You never held anything out on me before, honey.$ You aren't falling for this

Yeah?$ What did he want?$ Seems he has two tickets on a boat to Havana.$ And he says you're the other ticket.$ Seems he's a friend of this artist guy and he don't wanna let on he's competition.$ Mr. Quinlan, you stop!$ Listen, I got one of these hysterical husbands here tonight.$ Yeah.$ Say, why don't we make this a foursome?$ You and the artist, me and Standish.$ I'm not going to Havana.$ I'm just a poor working girl.$ Besides, we're working overtime tonight.$ Atta Kay, atta Kay.$ Don't worry.$ I'll be home later.$ Toodle-oo.$ Here you are, baby.$ Mr. Quinlan, if you ever do that again...$ I'm gonna sock you right in the nose.$ Do you mind if I sit here a while?$ No, I'd be glad to have you.$ Be careful there.$ Oh, don't worry about me.$ I never get dizzy.$ Look at them twinkle.$ Don't they, though?Like a lot of fireflies.$ And the people look like little bugs.$ Oh, not down there.$ Look up here.$ Oh, they're too far away.$ You can reach for them just the same.$ What good are they?$ A lot of good.$ Mariners use them to steer by when they lose their way.$ And they always get to port.$ Have you ever been to Arizona?$ Furthest west I've been is Jersey City.$ Great place to live Arizona.$ Great place to paint.$ No skyscrapers to stab the horizon.$ Nothing but purple hills.$ Even the stars seem closer.$ You can almost reach it and grab the big dipper by the hand.$ How long do you figure it's gonna take you to finish this painting?$ Oh, I don't know, why?$ I wanna quit.$ Wanna quit?$ Hm-hm.$ What for?$ Don't I pay enough?$ Yes.$ Well, what then?$ Oh, I don't know.$ Would it put you out any if I quit?$ Would you care?$ No, only I'd like to finish the job I started.$ Is that all?$ What do you mean is that all?$ What difference does it make whether you do finish it?$ Who cares?$ It'll be just another painting.$ The museum is full of paintings.$ Now look here, Miss Arnold.$ Miss Arnold, Miss Arnold!$ Can't you call me Kay?$ What am I?$ A statue or a hunk of furniture?$ That's the way you treat me.$ I'm a human being.$ Oh, I wish I was dead.$ Now, stop it.$ Cut it out.$ Kay.$ Don't, Kay.$ Please.$ Oh, I'm no good.$ You are so.$ I'll prove it.$ I'll put it on canvas.$ If you only won't quit.$ Well, I wouldn't quit for a million dollars.$ If you call me Kay I won't quit.$ I knew you wouldn't...$ Kay.$ I know it's a tiresome job.$ No, it isn't.$ It's a beautiful job.$ I love it.$ Even if it takes you fifty years to finish.$ Now, stop the crying.$ Am I good-looking?$ I'll say you are.$ Am I better looking than... that other one that comes up here?$ Well, that's a peculiar question.$ You're just not the same type at all.$ What were you saying about Arizona?$ Well...$ Everything's different out there.$ The stars are closer.$ The atmosphere is...$ Hold it.$ Hold it.$ That's the look I've been after.$ That's what I want to paint.$ Come on here now.$ Hold it now.$ Yes.$ Just the way you are now.$ Don't lose it.$ That's fine.$ Just the way you were.$ Just like that now.$ Oh, I'm all right.$ Will you take a little water?$ Please.$ I guess I got a little dizzy.$ I'm sorry.$ I can pose again in a few minutes.$ I'm awfully sorry.$ I didn't dream it was this late.$ I wouldn't have kept you sitting there that long.$ We'll quit now.$ I'll make this up to you, Miss Arnold.$ I'll give you an extra check.$ Much obliged.$ Well...$ I guess I'd better be going.$ Do you mind if I sit by the fire and warm before I go?$ Certainly not.$ You know, it's awfully late$ And it's raining.$ I think you'd better stay here all night.$ Oh, no, thanks I'll get a taxi.$ I don't want to put you out.$ It's no trouble.$ You can take my room.$ Oh, please.$ I'd rather not.$ I don't want to inconvenience you.$ Well, if you don't want to do that, take the couch.$ You mean you want me to stay here all night?$ Sure.$ If you feel better we'll get started early in the morning.$ Oh, boy.$ I'm glad we're started too.$ Yeah, we're started.$ I'll get you some things.$ I'lI bet this old couch is gossiping.$ You're the first young lady to spend the night in this studio.$ Yeah?$ Now tell me the one about the travelling salesman.$ Dot sure would get a laugh out of this.$ What was that?$ Nothing.$ Just talking to myself.$ Well.$ Here's some pajamas for you.$ I guess they'll be a little bit large, won't they?$ Well.$ I guess that'll be plenty warm, won't it?$ Hm-hm.$ If there's anything you want, just call me.$ Good night.$ Good night.$ Well, good night.$ There.$ Good morning.$ Oh, good morning.$ You didn't have to do that.$ There's a servant in the house.$ Well, I thought maybe if I cooked it myself, you might invite me to breakfast.$ Well, set them down there.$ You might put it down a little bit.$ Give me your plate.$ Oh, me?$ No, I'm not hungry.$ I never eat breakfast.$ Oh, here.$ Go ahead, you can read your paper.$ Don't mind me.$ Can you do that?$ I can do better than that.$ Young lady, come over here.$ Come on.$ Now what's the matter with you?$ Nothing.$ Nothing.$ I forgot your sugar.$ I know.$ You only take one.$ Oh, good morning, Jerry.$ Well, good morning, Governor.$ Meet Miss Arnold, my model.$ How do you do, Miss Arnold?$ How do you do?$ I hope I don't intrude.$ Oh, no.$ We worked late last night so...$ I understand.$ Art and all that.$ How come this early morning visit?$ Aren't the railroads running this morning?$ On schedule as usual.$ Machines are great things.$ They never get tired.$ But I am.$ Jerry, your mother and I are going away.$ To Paris for a year.$ Oh, that'll be a lot of fun.$ You deserve it, dad.$ You know, Paris is a great art center.$ How would you like to spend the year with us there?$ You and Claire.$ With Claire?$ Yes.$ Wedding first.$ Your mother suggested it.$ We thought it would be a good idea for you and Claire to get married next week.$ It's our wedding anniversary and we would make it a double honeymoon.$ We talked it over last night.$ Nobody's talked it over with me yet.$ That's what I dropped in for.$ I'm afraid I can't make it.$ I've got a lot of work to do.$ Is it more important than your wedding?$ No, but there's plenty of time for that.$ I don't agree with you.$ You've been engaged too long now, Jerry.$ That's what we were talking also about last night.$ We?Was I there?$ Don't you think I ought to be consulted about my marriage?$ Any reason for the delay?$ Yes.$ There's the picture I'm doing.$ The picture?$ Or the model?$ I wish you'd talk sense.$ I will, since you ask it.$ Young woman.$ Miss Arnold.$ After you've had your breakfast I suggest you drop in my office.$ You'll find me very liberal.$ What the devil are you talking about?$ Shall I tell him?$ Sure, tell both of us.$ Wait a minute now, Miss Arnold is my guest.$ I have every intention of treating Miss Arnold with the all respect she's entitled to.$ I've been very patient with you, Jerry.$ And I don't propose...$ Now just a moment, sir.$ Kay, do you mind going in to my room for a minute?$ I want to talk to my father alone.$ Wait.$ I'm sorry, Jerry.$ But she's got to hear what I have to say.$ Young woman, I've gone to the trouble of looking you up.$ I know all about you.$ Why you're here.$ You're not a model at all.$ Wait a minute.$ You're talking nonsense.$ Nonsense?$ Am I talking nonsense?$ Well?$ What have you got to say?$ Nothing.$ I'm going.$ She may not have anything to say but I've got plenty.$ You have no right to come in here like this.$ And I'm not gonna stand for you or anybody else.$ Wait, Jerry.$ I know what you're going to say but it doesn't make any difference.$ I hired her to be my model and I'm gonna paint her.$ No, you're not going to paint her.$ You're going to get rid of her.$ I think not.$ You know my wishes don't matter.$ Respect them or not, as you will.$ But I'll add this.$ If you do not get rid of that girl I'll do it for you.$ Kay!$ Don't you dare go out that door, do you hear me?$ You're staying right here.$ But your father...$ What's he got to do with it?$ Who hired you anyway?$ Now take off that coat.$ Come on.$ Now get to work.$ Now sit there and don't you move.$ Do you understand me?$ Oh, stop it.$ Tears all over the house.$ Come on now, chin up.$ Do you hear me?$ Chin up, I said.$ But, Jerry, after what your father told you...$ Do you think he told me anything I haven't known all along?$ Don't you think I know why you came up here?$ Do you think I'm blind?$ Don't you suppose I know what your game is?$ You took my pocketbook the first night I met you, didn't you?$ And I know what you are.$ You're nothing but a dirty little blackmailer.$ You're a thief.$ That's what you are.$ You're nothing but a common little...$ Don't say it that.$ Please.$ I'm sorry.$ Say it, Jerry.$ Please say it.$ Just once.$ Jerry.$ Oh, lock the door, Jerry, please.$ Why?$ I'm afraid.$ Someone might come in and take you away from me.$ Someone take you away from me?$ You wouldn't let them?$ They haven't got a chance.$ You think I'd let anybody take you away from me?$ That would be awful.$ I should say not.$ Don't you worry about that.$ I wish I were being born this morning.$ I wish I could be reborn all over again.$ So I could wait for you to come along.$ I wish I could be somebody else.$ So I could be everything... to you.$ Everything.$ Why, you're everything in the world to me now.$ Oh, Jerry.$ Sure, I don't care how my father takes it.$ I'm gonna tell him.$ Oh, no.$ Please don't tell him.$ Let's go to Arizona.$ Tonight.$ Now.$ You can paint.$ I can work.$ Gee, I'll cook for you and wash for you and everything.$ We don't need money.$ We don't need anybody.$ Oh, you stop worrying.$ Do you hear?$ I'm the boss now.$ Stop that.$ Come on now, let's see that smile.$ Can you do that?$ Sure... since you did.$ Come on now, sweetheart.$ Don't you worry.$ When I tell dad what you mean to me everything will be all right.$ Tell them I'll never get in their way.$ I'll change my name or something.$ They won't have to introduce me to people.$ I'll hide.$ If they only just let me be around.$ You tell them that, Jerry.$ Tell them.$ Believe me, I'll tell them plenty.$ Goodbye now.$ Don't you worry.$ I'll be right straight back.$ My heart isn't gonna beat again until I see you.$ Don't you worry.$ Everything is gonna be all right.$ I know how you feel, dad.$ Ever since I can remember you've been kind.$ You let me paint against your will because I loved it.$ And maybe the same thing that made me want to paint makes me love this girl.$ I don't care anything about your money but I want to keep you.$ Let's be friends.$ Kay and I will go away.$ We'll let nobody sneer at us.$ We'll hide away.$ Some day we'll come back with our kids.$ And you'll take her in your arms, I know you will, dad.$ And you'll be proud of me, too.$ What do you say, dad?$ Jerry... if you marry that girl, I never want to see you again.$ All right.$ Sit there.$ I don't care if I ever see you again either.$ Goodbye, mother.$ No, not goodbye.$ I want to see my Jerry again no matter what he may do.$ What do you want me to do?$ Whatever you think right, Jerry, dear.$ I knew you'd say that.$ Goodbye, dear.$ Dinner is served.$ Vanderbilt 7773, please.$ Hello.$ Hello, Kay?$ This is Jerry.$ Well, how long will it take to pack your things?$ I mean we're leaving.$ Leaving tonight for Arizona.$ Never mind, dear.$ I'll tell you later.$ You go home and pack.$ But what happened?$ I'll tell you later.$ Go home and pack.$ Alright.$ Come in.$ Miss Arnold?$ No, I'm Dot Lamarr.$ Anything I can do for you?$ No, it's a personal matter.$ Perhaps I'd better call later.$ Oh, no.$ Wait a minute.$ Sit down.$ Make yourself at home.$ Thanks.$ Do you think Miss Arnold will be home soon?$ Sure, don't worry.$ She's been doing a little posing for the last couple of months.$ Punching a timeclock.$ Can you beat that?$ Are you a friend of Miss Arnold's?$ I'll say so.$ We're more like sisters.$ I borrow her teddies and she's always using my lipstick.$ The reason we get along is we ain't in competition, you know.$ I don't think I quite understand.$ Oh, that's easy.$ The bozos that fall for me can't see Kay.$ And the johns who go gaga over Kay can't see me no matter how much there is of me.$ Kay and me never battle though.$ I'm gonna tell you.$ Between the two of us, they never get away.$ I'll never forget the night we...$ Hey, Dot, I got something to tell...$ Kay, there's a lady to see you.$ I've been entertaining her.$ You want me to mix up something?$ I would like to see you alone, Miss Arnold.$ Yes, certainly.$ Dot...$ I'm out like the light.$ I'm Jerry's mother.$ I'm glad to meet you.$ I guess Jerry's told you.$ Yes, and I must confess that I rather suspected to find a different sort of person.$ You mean you're disappointed?$ Quite the contrary.$ I'm most agreeably surprised.$ I'm sure you're a very clever girl.$ Clever?$ I don't blame Jerry a bit for being attracted by you.$ Thanks.$ And now that I've paid you a compliment, you must pay me one by admitting that you know why I'm here.$ But I don't.$ If there's anything I can do for you.$ I have some wealth, some position...$ There's a great deal that you might persuade me to do for you.$ Oh, I see.$ You've come here to make a deal with me.$ Well I don't mind the insult to me, Mrs. Strong, but you're insulting Jerry too.$ If you're trying to get me to give him up you're wasting your time.$ You've got no right to ask me.$ I won't do it.$ I'm not asking for myself.$ Jerry has split with his father.$ Mr. Strong is a man of the highest principles.$ And he doesn't approve.$ How about you, Mrs. Strong?$ Well, I don't know you.$ And your husband?$ What does he know about me?$ He tells me...$ Oh, wait.$ Don't say it.$ It's true.$ Won't you sit down?$ Thank you.$ I guess Jerry loves you an awful lot.$ I've heard him talk on the phone with you.$ I guess I'm in the worst jam anybody ever was.$ I wonder if you'll be kind enough to let me tell you my side.$ Certainly.$ Suppose somebody has... oh, say, consumption... that bars him from a lot of things.$ It's a kind of closed door.$ But supposing they're cured?$ Don't you think that door ought to open?$ Wait...$ Jerry knows all about me.$ I didn't want this to happen.$ I even fought against it.$ But it did.$ Jerry loves me and I love him.$ Do you believe that?$ Yes, I believe you.$ Your husband says he looked me up.$ Alright, but I'm different now.$ Do you believe that?$ I'm willing to believe that.$ Then why, why can't I?$ I understand.$ But most people won't.$ They consider you a handicap for Jerry.$ His friends will all slip away.$ Friends?$ His people.$ His world.$ He'll lose it and after a time he'll miss it and realize it.$ I know he won't blame you.$ But you'll blame yourself.$ That's why you must give him up.$ I love him.$ He's the only man I've ever loved.$ I couldn't live without him.$ I'll work for him.$ I'll take care of him.$ Gee, I'd die for him.$ He don't need his father, he don't need you.$ I won't give up.$ I won't listen to you.$ Get out!$ Get out.$ Oh, wait.$ Give me a minute to think.$ Excuse me, Mrs. Strong.$ Oh, I wish he was poor.$ I wish he was nobody.$ I wish he was sick so nobody else wanted him.$ Do you think I'm so bad?$ I don't think you're bad at all, my dear.$ I won't even say that you're not worthy of him.$ I'm not here to judge you.$ I'm here to ask you to give him up.$ Why?$ Why?$ Because you love him.$ And deep down in your heart you know the reason.$ You see, I'm being cruel because I love him.$ He'll hate me when he finds out.$ But I must risk his hate.$ I must fight for him.$ That's what mothers are for.$ Are they?$ I wish I had one to fight for me.$ The only break I ever got... the only thing in the world I ever wanted... and you ask me to give it up.$ I don't think that I have to ask you.$ You love him too much to want to hurt him.$ No...$ You don't have to ask me.$ You win.$ You all win.$ You won a long time ago.$ Long before I met Jerry.$ Long before any of us were born you won.$ But there's one thing you can't take away from me.$ He held me in his arms.$ And he told me he loved me.$ Oh, it's all right, Mrs. Strong.$ I liked you...laughingly.$ We both love him.$ And yet only one of us is willing to give him up.$ I'm rather ashamed of myself.$ And I shall always remember you, my dear.$ Oh, I wouldn't if I were you.$ Don't blame yourself.$ I probably would have figured it out myself if you hadn't tipped me off.$ Don't worry about me.$ Goodbye, Mrs. Strong.$ Goodbye, my dear.$ Please try not to hate me too much.$ I couldn't hate you.$ You're his mother.$ I couldn't help it.$ I was listening.$ Oh, that's awful.$ And I don't mind telling you.$ If you listen to that dame you're the biggest fool that ever was.$ That's all right.$ Aw, honey...$ Here...$ What are you gonna do?$ Go somewhere...$ He'll never see me again.$ Kay, are you drunk or something?$ That's an idea.Atta girl, Kay.$ Now you're talking.$ Oh, we're all out of it.$ Now come on, cheer up.$ Come on, you forget about it all and I'll be back in just a minute.$ And you wait right here now.$ And don't you move.$ Bryant 3420$ Telephone, sir.$ Am I in or out?$ Hello.$ Hello, Mr. Standish?$ This is Kay Arnold.$ Hello, hello.How are you?$ Fine.$ I feel like getting into trouble.$ I don't know whether to be insulted or complimented.$ You caught me right in the middle of my packing.$ I'm packing, too.$ Where am I going?$ Havana.$ Havana?$ Why that's a peculiar coincidence.$ I'm bound there, too.$ I'm going with you.$ Can you get another ticket?$ I always carry a spare for emergencies like this.$ You won't be disappointed.$ They tell me I'm pretty good company.$ If you really mean this you'd better hurry up because we're leaving at ten and...$ I'll stop by and pick you up a cab.$ I'll be ready.$ Just blow your horn and I'll come down.$ Oh, Mr. Standish...$ Is there a bar on the boat?$ A bar?$ That's all this boat is: just one long bar.$ Gee, that's great.$ Goodbye.$ Come in.$ I suppose you wanna know what happened.$ I think I can guess.$ They didn't understand.$ But it doesn't matter.$ Everything will be all right.$ I got a surprise for you.$ You know what it is?$ Tickets to Arizona.$ We're leaving at midnight.$ I was on my way now to throw my things together and I came by for you.$ Come on, honey.$ But I haven't finished packing yet.$ So you haven't.Well, how long will it take you?$ Oh, an hour maybe.$ Well...$ I'll be back for you.$ Wait a minute.$ I hope you didn't break with your folks altogether.$ I don't want you to lose anything on my account.$ No...$ Don't you worry.$ It's their loss.$ Not mine.$ And besides, we've got our own lives to live.$ If you and I were the only two people in this world...$ That's what it'll be like in Arizona.$ You know who our neighbours will be?$ Sheep.$ Come on, now.$ I gotta be going.$ Don't go, Jerry.$ Tell me some more about Arizona.$ All right.$ Well, to begin with, we'll get up every morning with the sun.$ And I'll cook breakfast?$ Yes, and we'll go horseback riding, out in the open every day.$ And I'll paint you on top of some mesa against the desert sunset.$ And when it gets dark we'll come home under the stars.$ There'll be millions of them.$ So close down that you can almost reach up and grab them.$ Tell me some more.$ Well, when we get home we'll be as hungry as a couple of wolves.$ And I'll cook you a grand dinner.$ Yes.$ And I'll read you last month's newspaper til you're drousy.$ And then you'll go to sleep in my arms.$ Like you did the first night I met you.$ Oh, Jerry.$ Blow the horn.$ What's that?$ Oh, nothing.$ I guess I'm so happy I'm jumpy.$ Run along now.$ You have to pack.$ What are you so nervous about?$ Nothing.$ Jerry!$ Hold me tight for a minute.$ Give her a horn.$ You have to go, I forgot.$ We're leaving at midnight.$ All right, now.$ I'll hurry back.$ Hey!$ Hey!$ Hey!$ Hey!$ You'll like Havana.$ Bright sun...$ Races, casino, bars all open...$ Lots of pretty girls just like you are.$ Vanderbilt 7773$ They don't answer?$ Well, thank you.$ Do you know anything about Arizona?$ No I don't, really.$ They tell me there's a lot of desert, though.$ What are you worrying about deserts for?$ Can you reach up and grab them in Havana?$ Grab what?$ The stars.$ Well, I don't think there's any law against it.$ When you get to Havana you can have the sun, the moon, the stars, the whole world.$ But you'll have to smile a little bit for it.$ Oh, don't worry about me.$ You needn't be afraid you're taking a dead woman along.$ I'll snap out of this like nobody's business.$ But you gotta promise me one thing.$ What?$ When we get on that boat I wanna get cockeyed.$ That makes it unanimous.$ A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right.$ Right along, folks.$ A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right.$ Right along.A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right.$ Right here, all right.$ Barroom is around the corner, sir.Alright.$ Thank you.$ Well, I'll be seeing you 12 miles out.$ Alright.$ Oh, come on.$ Chin up.$ Please don't say that.$ I'll see if the bar is open and we'll get cockeyed.$ Hey, there, wake up, wake up.$ Come on.$ Get me up to Jerry Strong's apartment.$ One moment, miss.$ You need to be announced.$ What name, please?$ Er, Lydia Pinkham.$ Very well, Miss Pinkham.$ Listen, just say it's a friend of Kay Arnold's calling.$ Very well, Miss Pinkham.$ Take a wire, please.$ Yeah, to Dick Howard.$ Mesa Grand,

course he won't hear a word against his music.$ Listen Tilla, no one ever left because of music from my publishing house.$ Nor because of my performance.But nobody said that.$ In any case...$ In any case you're innocent again.$ Of course, only I am to blame.$ But he never said that!$ You'd better be quiet, Baron.$ If you hadrt asked me to sing, all this wouldn't have happened.$ Of course, only I am to blame.Of course you are, who else?$ Of course, who else.$ Well, Madame, it's possible that a man has to... step outside for a moment.$ You dare mention such a thing to my face, you...$ You suckling!$ Do you want to step outside as well, perhaps?$ If only you too had left, no one would have kept you.$ You may all leave now, all of you!$ Tilla, please be sensible!$ Because of such a bagatelle, Tilla.What?$ You call that a bagatelle!$ If someone insults me in public?$ That is a bagatelle?$ I've had enough of you!$ I don't want to see you again!Adieu, Gentlemen!$ - Suckling!Because of my music!$ But there must have been something he didn't like.$ I don't want to see any of you three again!$ They behaved horridly.$ And what will Madame do without the three gentlemen?$ Herr Teschner managed all affairs with the theatre and the grammophone company.$ Then someone else will take care of them!$ And Herr Toenli managed all your financial affairs.$ Invoices, taxes, fees...$ Someone will be found for that, too.$ And who will be found whom you can shout at like the Baron?$ I'll shout at someone else.Yes, but at whom?$ I'll engage a private secretary.$ He can take care of my affairs.I'll pay him.$ And I'll shout at him as much as I like.$ I don't need favours from my friends anymore.A private secretary?$ He'll only steal your cigarettes and drink your cognac.$ Not a bad idea at all, a private secretary...$ I could have used someone like that long since.$ I'll place an advertisement.$ Private secretary wanted for lady artist$ Interviews at the New Operetta Theatre

Madame.$ Indeed!$ You!$ You and nobody else!$ Would you like to explain to me now... why you asked for the bill in the middle of the song that night?$ But one has to pay the bill before leaving, Madame.$ Yes, but why did you leave?$ Didrt you like my voice, my dress, my hairstyle?$ I found your hairstyle adorable.$ And my dress?$ - Wonderful.$ And my voice?$ - Enchanting.$ But what was the reason you left, then?$ The song.$ The song you were singing, Madame.$ The song?$ The song about the little Guards officer.$ You know, Madame, the melody was very nice.$ But the lyrics...$ Please try to imagine, someone really once was such a Guards officer and has gone through the same troubles as the one in your song.$ And now all this is the theme of a song... performed in nightclubs, for the amusement of others.$ So, you once were such a...$ Guards officer, yes.$ And now everything is over.$ It's even a good thing that it's over, with the uniforms, flags and so on.$ We went bankrupt, so to speak.$ But have you ever heard a song about a bankrupt banker?$ - So you see.$ But everyone is singing about us.$ And you know, if you listen to something like that about the past, and the old days, and even if you don't think about it anymore a hundred times, it does hurt a little.$ And that's why I left.$ Are you still very angry with me, Madame?$ Well, I must say this is the only reason I would never have thought of.$ Perhaps you would have been forever cross with me due to that little song.$ What kind of songs should I sing then, so that you don't run off again?$ Funny ones, modern ones, with syncopes for dancing.$ For example something like this!$ # If I could lie like Münchhausen, # or if I could fly like Eckener, # or if I could write poetry like Roda Roda # or if I were as flexible and pliant as a bayadere, # if I were as popular with women as Liedtke,$ # or if I could broadcast like Alfred Braun:$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist, # dududu dududu$ # I would already be a millionaire.$ # Dududu dududu$ # Every day I could draw money, # a thousand francs from the bank, # and live like the Shah of Persia, # all my life long.$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist # diddledida dida dada dada$ # I would already be a millionaire.# Shshsh shshsh$ # Then for you there would be only one man, and noone else,$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist, yes, if.$ For example something like this, Madame.Bravo, bravo, you are a perfect chansonnier!$ What else can you do?$ At your service:$ Dancing, singing, typing, stenography,English and French, horse-riding, chauffeuring, card tricks and fishing.Well, you won't have much opportunity for that with me.$ That's regrettable, Ma...$ So it's a deal!$ You'll stay with me.$ What about the fee?$ We won't need an arbitrator, Madame.$ - We'll talk about it later.$ Listen, the first thing you have to do is to arrange a tea party this afternoon at my apartment.I expect 15 guests at 5 o'clock sharp.$ All right, Madame, everything will be arranged at 5 o'clock sharp.$ The hazelnut cake is like a poem!$ The sandwiches are fabulous today.$ - Like in Vienna at Dehmel's.$ Yes, excellent.$ - Wonderful.$ I think everything today is so... exquisite.$ For the first time there is Bols!$ I don't usually drink, but...I will have a swig of it.$ 7-8-9-10-11-12-13?$ Heavens, we are 13 at the table?Well, I'm leaving at once.$ - But why 13?$ I invited 14, haven't I?$ Under no circumstances will I stay here as the 13th, I'm leaving!$ Stay, stay, we shall be 14 right now.Where's Herr Weidenau?$ In the kitchen, he shows the cook how to prepare an" ox-muzzle salad".$ Please tell him to come.- Yes, Madame.$ Herr Weidenau?$ - In the kitchen?$ Ox-muzzle salad?$ Who is that man after all?$ An old acquaintance.$ Keep on playing.Today he won't bite.$ Allow me to introduce...$ Herr Weidenau, my private secretary.$ What can I do for you, Madame?I'd like you to have tea with us.$ Because we are 13 at the table!$ It would have been a pleasure anyhow.$ - Don't mention it, Miss.$ Since when do you have a private secretary?Since today.$ Do you mind?$ I just find it a little strange, a single lady and a private secretary...So you're jealous?$ - That's ridiculous.$ I only think that a lady secretary would have been sufficient, if you absolutely...$ Speaking of' if':Won't you play some dance music for us?With pleasure, Madame.$ Give us the song you sang this morning, it was excellent.$ - Yes.As you like.$ # Thousand words speak of glamour and power,$ # Thousand words whisper of happiness and splendor.$ # And if thousand words spoke to you of the most beautiful things,$ # And if thousand words could name you everything that is nice,$ # There is one word that destroys all dreams.$ # Have you heard that word before?$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist, # dududu dududu$ # I would already be a millionaire.$ # Dududu dudu$ # Every day I could draw money, # a thousand francs from the bank, # and live like the Shah of Persia # my whole life long.$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist, # shshshsh shsh$ # I would already be a millionaire.$ # Then for you there would be only one, and noone else,$ # Yes, if the little word' if' did not exist, yes, if.$ Bravo, bravo!Once again!$ A dance!$ And ladies' choice!$ With pleasure, Madame.$ I'm very satisfied with you.- Thank you, Madame.$ You make excellent coffee.$ Yes, I learned it from an aunt of mine, aunt Hanne.$ And the hazelnut cake, it was heavenly.$ I learned that from another aunt, aunt Lore.$ And the rolls, how sophisticated you made them!I learned to make them from aunt Hannelore.$ And you're quite a dancer!From which aunt did you learn that?$ I think it must have rather been a cousin?$ Besides, yourjob won't be too taxing.$ I'm at your service, Madame.Only...$ I only ask for one thing.$ What is it?$ I'd like to have have my evenings off, between 8.15 and 10.15.$ So don't you want to come to the theatre to see me perform?$ Allow me to have these two hours for myself, Madame.The other gentlemen always come to the theatre.$ But they are in love with you, Madame.$ Indeed.$ Of course you can dispose of your time any way you like, Herr...Weidenau.$ Has your private secretary again not turned up to see the show?$ How should I know whether he has turned up or not?$ I was just asking...$ Say, since when do you buy your perfume at Fleuron?$ At Fleuron?$ I never buy anything there.$ What makes you think so?$ Well, I saw your private secretary buy perfume there.$ I thought it was for you.$ No, it wasrt for me.$ Well, then he must have bought it for another lady, right?$ What did you say?$ I didn't said anything!$ Too bad.$ Say, Tilla, where is your private secretary during the performance?$ Don't ask silly questions!How should I know where he is?$ Ah, good evening, Sir.- Good evening, Anna!$ Is Madame very angry because I'm late?$ Not at all, she's only afraid that the soup might get cold.$ Oh, I couldn't come earlier.$ Come in.$ But it would be so nice...$ No, no, no, really not!$ - But Tilla, dear...$ I'll stay at home.$ - But why?$ I won't go out tonight.$ We just would have dropped in at the Carlton.$ Yes, to have a bite.$ - And a drink.$ I've had some supper prepared for me here, I'll stay at home.$ I'd like to talk to you about the new play.$ Weidenau will take care of that.$ I'd like to talk over the bank affairs, Madame.$ Weidenau has already finished that matter.$ Yes, I think Weidenau has finished us all off already.$ Then all we can do is wish you a good night.$ Goodbye, until tomorrow!$ - Goodbye, Madame!$ Good night, my little one, go for a stroll and have fun!$ Madame, we will go for a stroll, but we won't have fun.Good night!$ Good night, Baron dear.$ Do I also have to leave, Tilla?$ Yes, Baron dear.$ Be a good boy and have a nice sleep.$ I'm neither a good boy nor will I have a nice sleep.$ I don't sleep nicely anymore.$ But why, Baron dear?$ As long as you're not happy, I can't sleep.$ But who says I'm not happy?$ - My inner voice.$ Tell your inner voice that it mustrt talk so much, and go to sleep.$ Good night.$ Madame?$ I'm not hungry, you needrt serve anything.$ But Madame...$ - You can go, I don't want anything.$ I only wanted to say that...$ - Go, and leave me alone!$ Why aren't you in the Carlton bar yet?$ Well...$ Why am I not in the Carlton bar, indeed?$ I'll go there.$ Well, what are you doing here?$ Good evening, Madame!$ Beg your pardon, I didn't think you'd come home so soon.$ But what do you want with that old marionette theatre?$ It was quite dusty and broken, and so I wanted to repair it.$ Now, in the middle of the night?$ - Well, I rarely have the time by day.$ So what do you want to do with it?$ I thought that if I am to entertain you or your guests again... there should be some variation, you can't sing all the time like in a sound film.$ But do you know how to play with marionettes?$ An old puppeteer taught me in Salzburg.$ Excellent, you must show me!$ With pleasure, only I'm not sure if I still can do it.$ Let's have a dress rehearsal!$ With pleasure, but I'm...$ Well, go ahead, go ahead!$ For once I'll sit in the audience and watch the others perform.$ Seat no. 1, orchestra stalls, front row.$ You're welcome, Madame, just one moment.$ Five minutes

curtain rises, grand overture.$ The curtain opens.$ The meadow lies in the sunlight, centre stage a linden tree with hearts carved into its bark.$ Cowbells chiming, the prince enters singing.$ # Here I am, it's the familiar spot.$ # I have been away for full nine full moons.$ # I love Lieschen, the Postmaster's child, # she's a child like children are, # she is quite a lot to me, # just like what the yolk is to the egg # or what the salt is to the radishes,$ # for me that is, yes, for me that is # my Postmaster's Lieschen.$ # My prince!$ # So there you are, honourable prince!$ # You are the Imperial Count of Peppermint.$ # I knew you would be drawn to this linden tree, # by the yearning for the Postmaster's child.$ # But Prince, consider your princely duties,$ # A prince is not allowed to love, # a prince must do without!$ # All right then, I'll do without!# So be it.$ # I'll hurry to the capital with lightning speed,$ # There she comes, how beautiful is her beloved face!$ # She still has a lisp, but only when she's speaking.$ # I am Lieschen, the Postmaster's child,$ # I have a carefree mind, like chaff in the wind.$ # I am in love with a rather distinguished gentleman, # for nine months now he's been away from me.$ # I never did hear his love whisperings, # my Bruno, my Bruno, # there he is, there he is, there he is!$ # I am struck by the moonshine, I often groaned like a wood cock,$ # So now you will never part from me?$ # She doesn't suspect anything, I have to confess everything to her.$ # Bruno, you're suddenly so pale and green!# Do you perhaps want an aspirin?$ # Listen to the tidings:I am not your Bruno!$ # I am the hereditary prince, I am Prince Kuno!$ # You are the hereditary prince of Titipo, # then I would be a princess!$ # Holladriho holladriho...$ # Oh Lieschen, a prince who wants to be a real prince # can never woo a commoner.$ # You abandon me?$ You would dare?$ # What will my father, the Postmaster, say?$ # My P-p-p-prince, I heard e-e-e-everything, # will you allow me three words now?$ # Perhaps you would like to sing, it's more comfortable.$ # St-st-stammering is more pleasant when you are singing.$ # Listen to my confession, trust me blindly:$ # Lieschen isn't my child!# She's not your child?$ What do you say there, man?$ # Just listen to me quietly for a moment.$ # It was about 18 years ago, on the 31st February to be precise,$ # I was sitting in my po-po-postmaster's office.$ # Gypsies came down the road, carrying the brats they had robbed with them:# A new-born child in napkins.$ # I caught the rascals, all nine of them, and bust in their heads.$ # The last one confessed to me with his skull cracking # that the child had been stolen from the prince's palace.$ # You, girl, you are that child

Superb!$ But tell me, why must the postmaster's daughter become a princess at the end?$ Every good postmaster's daughter becomes a princess at the end... so that she gets her prince.Must they always get each other in the end?$ They don't have to, no, but the audience likes it much better.$ And it's much nicer... when two in love get each other in the end, isn't it, Madame?$ Well... if you think so, you Prince Kuno...$ Is there a postmaster's daughter somewhere that you're in love with, and a linden tree with hearts carved into its bark?$ I just wanted to tell you...I don't like it when a gentleman wears such a collar.$ In the future, wear shirts cut in the modern fashion, whith the collar attached.$ Collar and shirt in one piece,Herr Weidenau.Yes, of course, Madame, if you wish...$ Yes, it is my wish!$ By the way, it's quite late...$ - I'm leaving, Madame.$ So, goodbye.$ Tomorrow, 11 o'clock sharp!$ Good night.$ She said she needs a few nights off.$ To repose.$ In the old days,

ordered a new gown for eight days.I'm telling you she's ill, she's really ill.$ Poor Tilla!$ Well then, let's go to the golf course.$ Allright, let's play golf.$ What is it?$ It's 11 o'clock.$ Who is it?$ It's me, Weidenau.$ Good morning, Madame.$ What do you want so early?$ I was to wake you at 11.$ You always come at such inconvenient hours.$ Don't disturb me.$ Because I'm not...I still have

address you, Madame?$ You shouldn't address me at all!$ You should leave me alone!$ And not torture me!$ Good gracious!$ But you're totally beside yourself!$ What is it?Dearest...$ Madame...$ You see.$ That way you said it nicely.$ And you must always say" Madame" to me that way.Good morning!$ But that's sweet of you, Baron dear... that you've come to see me.I hope I'm not disturbing you.$ Not at all, Baron.$ Not at all.$ What are the others doing?$ But you're all totally neglecting me!$ Listen to me, I want to go out tonight.$ Dancing, singing, being gay... drinking champagne, being among other people, listening to music...$ So you're really in love, huh?I?In love?$ But you must be mad, Baron!$ With whom should I be in love?$ With the little Guards officer.$ I swear, I'm not in love, really I'm not.$ Is that so?$ Well, if you swear... then your infatuation must be overwhelming, my dear child.$ What if?$ Then you are very foolish to be.$ Why?$ Because your little Guards officer has another woman.$ What?$ I've watched him a bit, spied on him a little.$ Feldstraße 18, 3rd floor, left.$ What does that mean?It means there's another lady.$ What kind of a lady?$ The lady between 8.15 and 10.15.$ Between 8.15 and 10.15?$ Havert you noticed that your private secretary is always absent between 8.15 and 10.15?$ He spends his time with this lady, Feldstr. 18, 3rd floor, left.Now I know what you mean!$ The lady in Feldstr. 18, 3rd floor, left.$ But of course!$ You knew about her!$ His English teacher, he visits her daily.$ But he speaks English fluently.$ Or his French teacher...$ But his French is better than Poincaré's!$ Some teacher then, Chinese or Bulgarian, how should I know!$ Besides, my private secretary can do whatever he wants between 8.15 and 10.15.$ And tomorrow, and with whom he wants.$ With whom he wants...$ I wouldn't have thought that she's that much in love with him.$ Jerome Toenli is pleased to invite you to his home tonight$ # Once people had time for love, # they were writing spring romances, # but if today's boys and girls are in love # they don't talk a lot, they dance # love is a heavenly power$ # that's what they used to say in the earlier days # we don't think much about heaven # today's people just say:$ # Love is like a sound film # with lots of changes in the course of action, # first an' oh' and an' ah', then a big quarrel, # and gradually one becomes weak again.$ # Love is like a sound film # the main characters are the two of us # first a sweet caress, then the inevitable # a little song with greeting and a kiss at the end.$ # Love is like a sound film # with lots of changes in the course of action # first it's all' attentior, then a big quarrel, # but gradually one becomes weak again.$ # Love is like a sound film # the main characters are the two of us # first a sweet caress, then the inevitable, # a little song with greeting and a kiss at the end.$ Well, did you bring Tilla with you?$ No, I thought Madame was already here.$ No, Tilla hasn't come yet.$ That is strange.$ Madame asked me to be here at 8.15.$ And told me to be punctual.$ She expressly asked me not to fetch her.$ She'll just be a bit late.$ This happens sometimes with a beautiful woman.$ - That's possible.$ In fact it's a great honour for us... to have the private secretary join us between 8.15 and 10.15.$ On other nights you're always invisible at that hour, you...$ As you can see, I can also be visible at this hour.$ I really don't know where Madame might be...$ Who shall I say is...$ Just tell her, I've come because of Herr Weidenau.$ Please come in.$ One moment.$ Please be seated.- Thank you.$ Herr Weidenau isn't in?No, he's invited tonight.$ But on other nights he's always here?$ Yes, each night he has supper with Madame.$ Between 8.15 and 10.15.I see.$ And then he leaves?Yes.$ But not for long.$ At midnight he's back again.$ What?$ He comes back?At night?- He does.$ - And spends the night here?$ But of course he does!$ That's his bedroom.$ And where does Madame sleep?$ - Right next door.$ Right next door?$ She always waits for the gentlemars return, else she can't fall asleep.$ Is that so?$ Madame...$ I've come for my Ulli's shirts?$ Yes I know.$ Greetings, Madame.$ Mrs. Schmidt has recommended you to me.$ Yes I know, come with me, we'll see to it at once.$ Because we have to alter all the shirts.$ Ulli has set his mind to it.$ The boy's totally crazy these days.$ Because he's in love, you know.$ And probably somebody told him that it's more elegant if the collars are attached to the shirt.$ And that's why we have to alter everything.$ Let the boy have his will.$ At my time, things like that werert done.$ If a gentlemen had taken a lady out without wearing a starched collar... she would have given him some look!$ The modern times...$ Well, come here, Madame.$ Listen to me carefully!$ Look here, you cut off a strip from the bottom, four fingers wide.$ You won't notice it at the bottom...$ And you'll sew that to the collar.$ And try to do it nicely, will you... so that my Ulli will be pleased.$ Herr Waldenau is your son, Madame?$ No way!$ Ulli?My son?$ What is he?$ But he's my grandson!$ - You're his...$ - Grandmother.$ But of course.$ And now that he's found a steady job he's made me come from Vienna at once.$ The poor guy.Because he thought he'd feel lonely in the strange city.$ But I had hardly arrived... when he fell in love.$ And who do you think he's in love with?With the lady who employs him.$ He fell madly in love with her.$ And with my Ulli that means something!Because he used to ignore all women.$ Really?$ And what's most interesting... he doesn't dare to tell her.$ She doesn't know anything about his love.Did you ever hear such a thing!$ She doesn't know!But why doesn't he tell her?$ But he's not going to tell her!$ You don't know my Ulli!$ He knows his duties, he knows how to behave.$ She's his boss, he's the employee.That's final.$ He puts professional duties above everything.So that's why?$ Of course!$ And I keep telling him, you silly boy, I'm telling him, if you love her, you can be her employee a thousand times, you simply have to tell her!$ Of course!$ - You see!$ But you know, my Ulli, he's a gentleman of the old school.$ For him a woman either means everything... or only an adventure.$ And just for an adventure, this woman is too good for him.$ 12, 13, 14That's it, 14 shirts.$ But say... how much do you charge for the alterations per shirt?$ 45 pfennigs, if it's not too expensive, Madame?$ 45 pfennigs?That's reasonable.$ Yes, that's reasonable.$ And I'll give you his drawers, too, they need mending anyway.$ One moment.$ And the next time you come I'll give you his socks to darn.$ That boy can make holes, I'm telling you!Once worn, and ruined already!$ Westend 8586.$ Excuse me, do you know if Frau von Treuberg lives here?Are you the seamstress, perhaps?$ Yes, Frau Schmidt recommended me.$ This is excellent!$ Because I was about to bring you the clothes anyway.$ Everything's in here, drawers, the young gentlemars shirts...Now listen carefully.$ You cut off a strip down here, about four fingers width... at the bottom you don't notice it anyway... and you stitch it to the collar seam.$ But do it nicely, so that my Ulli will be pleased.$ But where to?Yes...$ You don't know?$ Thank you.$ But don't be so impatient!$ She'll be here any moment.$ Just wait here.$ I'd like to speak to you alone for a minute.$ As you wish.$ I'd like to talk to you about Tilla's new part.$ Pardon.$ - You're welcome.$ The choice of her new part is very important to Tilla right now.$ Tilla is at the peak of her career.$ An artist has to be very careful at that moment.$ And especially the two of us,$ I as her publisher and you as her... advisor, must prevent her from making mistakes, isn't that so?$ In the play, Tilla plays an artist who hurries from success to success, is adored by the public and celebrated, and one day she falls in love with some poor devil.$ Of course, passionate love between the two... till the man suddenly realizes that it wouldn't be good for this woman if that love lasted forever.$ She's an artist, she needs luxury, riches, success, all sorts of things the man can't offer her.You understand that, don't you, Herr Weidenau?She's an artist like...$ like... like Tilla, and he a poor devil like... like...$ In short:$ The young man realizes that this affair will lead to nothing, because such affairs never lead to anything.$ And since he realizes that despite all his love he would always only be his wife's husband,he leaves of his own accord,$ While it doesn't hurt too much yet.$ This is the show's central song, the farewell song.$ # Don't ask why I'm leaving, # don't ask why, # whatever may happen # don't ask why.$ # I can only tell you$ # I love you.$ # I wanted to give you the most beautiful thing in life.$ # Don't ask me that one question,

anymore#" why?"$ I think it's... strange... that you're telling this to me right this moment.$ Why?After all you're Tilla's...- Private secretary!$ But nothing else.$ And for that reason,$ I must ask you not to tell me the plot of plays$ I am supposed to take as example.It's quite unnessecary.$ The characters in your new play, the lady artist and the young man, bear no resemblance to...$ Frau Tilla and... the young man you're alluding to.$ So you've understood me.$ Yes I have.$ But even without your friendly admonition$ I would have known my duty.$ I don't know what you mean, Madame.$ Is that so?You really don't know?$ Yes, the grammophone recordings, they will take place the day after tomorrow.$ And?$ The fashion drawings have been ordered from Paris.$ And?The pictures for the magazine will be ready tomorrow.$ - And?$ And?$ Apart from that, I really don't know, Madame.$ Is that so?Apart from that, you have nothing else to tell me?$ I see.$ Then I am going to tell you something!$ Or even better, take a letter!$ - Very well, Madame.Write:$ Headline:$ Beloved!$ What I didn't know before,$ I know now.$ I know that you love me.That you love...$ I know that your sense

her tonight.$ As a matter of fact, it was about- - well, you see, mr. constable, both these ladies are, I mean were that's playing at the theatre royale this week.$ And as I was leaving the theatre, you see I'm the stage manager, and mr.$ Druce here, he's the general manager.Well, you see, when I left the theatre tonight,I was invited to join them.$ Wait.$ Wait a minute, wait a minute.One at a time, please.$ They killed you, Edna.$ They killed you.$ Tell me, darling.Who, darling?$ Did she do it?$ You always hated Edna.$ Thought yourself too good for us...$ With your high and mighty ladylike

with poor Edna Druce, and I know for a fact that they hadn't been on speaking terms for the last 7 weeks.$ Miss Diana said nothing to me about it.$ Well, it's a fact.$ I don't believe she could have done it, though there's no denying she is headstrong.$ I should say so.$ Why, she gave in her notice the other day over Edna.$ Who, miss Diana?$ Yes, but, uh...Druce didn't want to lose her, so Edna would've been glad enough to see her go.$ Then suddenly...$ Suddenly, last night, she changed, asked if they could make it up.$ Diana was puzzled but asked her home to supper.$ Now, I can't help

remarked to Fane, our leading man, about it.$ He saw them, as well, you know.$ Why?Is it very unusual?$ Unusual?$ I should say so.$ It's an absolute miracle.$ As I was saying to my wife,$ I said,"

man.$ I assure you, inspector,I'm not the other woman in the case.I know that, mr.$ Fane, but I understand you saw the 2 women together last night.$ Yes, just before I left the theatre, then I went straight to my rooms.$ Well, Ion Stewart came with me.$ He came and he wanted to borrow some cigarettes.$ He'd lost his case or something, and then I went straight to bed.$ Say, excuse me, I'm on.$ Reginald, darling, has that cat gone yet?$ Ooh, it's you, cousin Yettie.$ Don't you dare to try to run away from me.$ Come here when I speak to you.$ No, no, you don't.$ That's the bathroom.$ Come

Doucie, remember, she's only just dead.$ I've never heard yet that telling the truth was a disgrace.$ Only been one year about Edna and Stewart anyhow.$ And the way I take it, mr.$ Stewart and mrs.Druce...$ Excuse me.My line.$ Don't bother to show me through.I know my way.$ This is not the first time, Reginald.Everything's going splendid.$ Well, perhaps I ought not to say$ Edna and Stewart like that.$ But, Ted, you know what Edna was like, anyone she liked had to be wrote in.$ Quick!In here!$ Excuse me a minute, inspector.$ Shan't be long.There's a quick change.$ How do you do?No, I'm sorry.He's not here.$ What have they done with her?$ Why, she's down at the station, I expect.$ Did she say anything, do you know?$ Is there anything I can do?$ Markham, you don't really think she's done it, do you?$ Why have they arrested her?Saw it with me own eyes.$ She was with the poker in her hand just by her side anyway.$ Blood.Covered with blood.Why, what's the matter with you?$ Blood always makes me feel sick, even the mention of it.$ Yeah.$ Yeah.Why not?$ Members of the jury,$ Diana Baring is indicted and stands charge with the willful murder of Edna Druce.$ It is your duty to inquire whether she is guilty or not.I need not remind you that in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.$ The crime of murder in England, at least, is judged dispassionately.$ Neither beauty nor youth nor provocation can mitigate...She gave me the strangest look.$ Half-surprised...$ And half-angry.And she said:" How dare you!"$ And I don't remember anymore.$ I just don't remember.$ Must have happened when I was not conscious of myself.$ That's all I can say.$ Our defense is a complete denial of all responsibility.$ You've been able to observe the behavior of the prisoner in the dock...And in the witness box.$ My learned friend has referred to her behavior as hardened.$ Gentlemen and ladies of the jury, is there anything so hardy as the behavior of sheer innocence?$ If you're convinced that the story of the defense represents the facts it is your duty to discharge the accused.$ I shall like to remind you that truth is often stranger than fiction.If, on the other hand, you are convinced that the evidence is indeed fiction, then I must tell you in the words of the counsel of the prosecution that neither youth nor beauty nor provocation can be held to mitigate$ the crime of murder.$ Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen, we can't talk standing.$ Why, I say, may we smoke?$ Yes.I don't see why not.$ That is, if the ladies haven't any objection.No.Not at all.$ Because after all, I think it's pretty clear and I really don't think it'll be necessary for us to examine all the evidence again in detail.$ Now, in the first place, the prosecution.$ They say that the girl and the dead woman were on bad terms.$ They make it up.$ Edna Druce comes to supper, they both have a drop too much and begin quarreling about some man.$ For instance, you heard how the landlady said that she heard raised voices.$ And the girl admits as much but won't give the name of the man.Now that in itself is fishy.$ The girl gets hold of the poker, loses her temper, and there's the end of Edna Druce.$ The prosecution argues that it has proofs.$ Practically caught red-handed.$ Girl's dress all over blood, the poker at her feet, brandy flask empty, and the girl half-silly.$ And in addition to that, no other person was known to have entered the house.$ I think that's pretty clear.I think you ought to mention that the girl comes of a good family.$ Yes, but it's those so-called well-bred people who are able to remain so brazen in the face of a thing like this.$ Well, look at the way she behaved in the box.$ Half a minute, ladies.Let's get on.Now, take the defense.$ They don't deny she did it but argue that their case is that the thing happened when...She was in a fit or something.$ Surely it is clear to you that in the evidence for the defense the doctor put forward a theory that it was due to the independent activity of the suppressed experience.$ In other words, disassociation, which in this particular form is called a fugue.$ So that a person displaying the strangest behavior for a considerable period of time would be quite unaware of this when he or she regained normality.$ Well, I think the best thing for us all to do is to write down our opinions and then we can see how we stand.$ Whichever in the minority...$ Can then give their individual reasons and the thing can be worked out that way.$ That makes 7 guilty...$ And 3 not guilty.$ There are 2 not in.$ I take it you haven't come to any decision at all.$ I think the whole business is hateful.There's too much responsibility put on our shoulders.$ Either we've got to let her go free- - that's not fair to the rest of the world if she's guilty- - or we got to hang her$ But if we recommend her to mercy.$ Mercy?Is that what you call it?$ 20 years cut out of life.$ The best years and to spend them in hell.$ Have you ever been inside a prison?$ It takes a civilized community to think out a punishment like that.I think you exaggerate.$ It's no use confusing the issue like this.$ People who do wrong have got to be punished somehow.$ You can't run the world on sentiment.$ No, but that's what we've tried to do.Save the unfit.$ Get more children and make glorious wars to be rid of.$ Your verdict, mr.Shackleton.$ Who's the other one?$ You, mr.Matthews?$ Is there anything special troubling you so that you can't make a decision?$ What is it prevents you from making a decision?$ Well, nothing really.$ Uh, well, uh...$ Have you made up your mind at all what it's going to be?$ You heard the case for the prosecution.That's pretty clear, isn't it?And you know what the defense is, don't you?$ Don't quite understand what the lady meant when she said no.When, uh...When she spoke.$ Ward was only trying to tell you that the defense was that murder was committed in a fit of daytime sleep walking.$ But, uh...$ The murder took place at nighttime.$ Now that leaves only 3 for not guilty.$ I'll give you my reasons for not guilty.The evidence for the defense by the doctor is to my mind conclusive.Anyone who's followed the modern trend of pscyhological investigations must be aware that any person suffering from severe mental strain, such as the prisoner may have been following on so many rehearsals and things, may bring about a sudden condition$ in which the patient is no longer either conscious of or responsible for their actions.$ We've already had evidence that the prisoner's mind is a delicately balanced one and quite liable through some hidden flaw in that mind to become deprived of all consciousness and readily enter into a state wherein the body is still functioning,$ though no longer under the control of the will.$ And it is on these grounds, that I feel that Diana Baring must have been the victim of circumstance.$ I have no doubt that mrs.$ Ward is right.That being the case, it is quite liable to recur, possibly with the same results.Well, that's a point I hadn't considered.$ Well, it's really important.$ Because with this poor gal, you have to consider not only this one tragedy but others that may follow it.$ There may be other crimes lying...You mean, there's a sort of dual personality in her.One of these persons is violent and cruel and the other, just an ordinary woman.$ If we set this bad personality free, we must be prepared to show her the responsibility.$ Now, mr.After all you've heard, does your opinion still remain the same?$ Well, you know, I find it very difficult to believe that a girl of that sort should do such a thing.$ After all, she looks perfectly riveting, you know.$ Well, you know what I mean?$ A sort of girl one would like for a daughter.$ I presume, sir, that an ugly woman would stand very little chance at your hand.$ The thing you've got to decide, mr.$ Daniels, has nothing to do with the qualities of the young lady as they appeal to you.$ Yes, of course.I know that.$ But, that's all, well, you know what I mean.It's...$ It's pretty awful and all that sort of thing.$ Besides the thing you're thinking of, what's your verdict?$ Well...Oh...$ Guilty, I suppose.$ Well, now we're practically complete.$ There's just sir John.$ Well, don't dismiss me as easily at that, mr. foreman.Yes?$ We mustn't be long.Time is money, you know?$ Time in this case, may I remind you, is life.$ If I'm delaying you all, I apologize.$ I admit that I am not...A man of business.I'm a poor actor.$ I repeat...The poorest of poor players.$ And my time on the stage will be shortened had I not for years trained myself to...$ How shall I put it...$ To apply the technique of life... to the problems of my art.$ But today, ladies and gentlemen, that process is reversed.$ I find myself applying the technique of my art to a problem of real life.And my art is not satisfied.$ In the first place,$ I am fairly convinced that Diana Baring was telling the thruth when she said she remembered nothing.$ In fact, I have been impressed by her behavior all through the trial.$ Oh, please don't think I'm taking the same line as our friend mr.Daniels here.$ He made a very gallant attempt, but I assure you my reasoning goes a little deeper.$ I am convinced further that she was again telling the truth when she said she had drunk no brandy.$ Buy you've forgotten the evidence of the police sergeant.$ He said she smelled of drink and appeared dazed on arrest.$ How do you know that was not the wine she had at dinner?What about the evidence of Markham, the stage manager?$ He found the empty brandy flask right on the spot.Yes, but- -$ What about the evidence of the actor, Stewart?$ He said the women had been enemies for some time.Ah, he was the one who said prisoner was rough to mrs.$ All pointing to her violent nature, sir John.$ Yes, but that was not altogether borne out by Fane.You know, the, um...Well, the female impersonator man.$ But his evidence was of little use.$ He was so obviously in love with the prisoner.$ In any case, everything was perfectly clear when the body was discovered.$ Why, the woman was actually caught in the room red-handed.$ And found with a poker by her side.$ And her dress all over blood.$ And quarrelling over a man.$ That's right.$ Any answer to that, sir John?$ Think of her personality.$ She's not the kind of girl to get drunk.Brandy in the flask, was there?$ She doesn't deny it.$ That's right.$ Any answer to that, sir John?$ Not at the moment.$ Was there anyone entered the house that night?$ Landlady says not.Girl says not.$ They were alone.$ Any answer to that, sir John?$ Not at the moment.$ But have we taken it too much for granted that no one else could've done the murder?$ They were alone.Says they quarelled.$ Any answer to that, sir John?$ She does not admit it.$ She says she doesn't remember.$ Is that a guilty woman's answer?$ And her dress all over blood.$ Stand up.$ Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?$ And do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?Guilty.$ Diana Baring, have you anything to say?$ My sentence of death should now be passed upon you according to law.It's absurd, I tell you.It's absolutely absurd.$ oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes$ Adjourned until tomorrow.$ The Baring murder trial came to a conclusion today with a verdict of guilty, and sentence of death was passed on Diana Baring.$ And that is all the news.$ But here is an S.O.S., which has just been brought into the studio.$ We've been asked by the commissioner of police to broadcast the following- -$ The brandy cocktail you ordered, sir.$ Right.Ring up mr.Bennett, will you?$ And ask him to bring me the details of the receipts for the last 3 nights.$ Also,... booking...$ With New Scotland Yard to telephone Victoria 7000 or with any police station.$ Our concert tonight is an orchestral one, given by the radio symphony orchestra.$ They start by playing the overture to Tristan und Isolde by Wagner.$ Funny that S.O.S.Coming on top of that other.$ Save her soul.$ Save her.If I'd stood up longer,I might have worn them down.$ Why couldn't they see the girl as I did...The rest of the fellows on the jury.$ But anyone standing in the dark on a charge like that...$ Probably looks different from the same person somewhere else.$ Ah, amusing the way she stood up to everybody.$ There's no doubt that did her a lot of harm.$ And I wonder what her feelings are now.$ Who drank that brandy?!$ Why didn't I force that point home to them?$ Easy to figure these things out afterwards.The girl said she didn't drink it.$ Yet she admits she might have killed Edna Druce.$ That's queer.$ Why admit a big thing like that and yet be sure she didn't do a small thing such as drink a drop of brandy?$ All that came to light to me today.$ I'm sure I was right when I raised that.Quite frankly, more certain now.$ Bennett.Glad you're back, sir John.$ Been reading about it all.$ Plenty of publicity.$ You having met days before.$ Well, she wanted to become a star, a year ago that was.I suppose you can say in a sense that she has.$ A star in a murder- -$ Bennett, please.Look here.$ Get hold of my understudy.$ Tell him he has to go on again tonight.$ Pray god that I give him a better role.$ 5-9-9-3.Yes.$ I want you, as well, to get hold of as many as you can of the members of that company.$ You know, the touring company at the time of the murder.$ In particular, the, um... funny little man, the stage manager.$ I forget his name.$ I'll see him at the office in the morning.$ Temple bar, 5, double 9, 3.$ But I thought the trial was over, sir John.$ No, my dear, Bennett, the trial is not over, by a hell of a long way.$ I am.No, don't wait.$ Go.$ Why did I send her away?Told her it'd be good for her to gain experience...$ Uh...I think, uh...Boiling it all down, dear,$ Accept sir John's offer after all, don't you?$ Oh, yes.Either that one or one of the other 2.$ It's all the same to me.$ That would be sir John himself.$ I don't think.$ Seems she won't let us stay on here any longer.$ That means Lucy will have to go back to her aunt's- - oh, I mean, uh- -$ Sophie will have to go back to her aunt Lucy.I don't want to go back to aunt Lucy.$ I want to go on tour with you.$ I can't let you go back to sir John's.$ I really thought you were kidding me, I really did.What is this?$ Ooh.$ It's from sir John himself.$ If we could be in his office at 12: 00.$ Do you think we could get there in time today?$ If we try.$ I'll turn the kettle off.$ This just needs a little benzine.$ Dear, I don't think...$ Petrol will get the shine out of this suit.$ I'll say!There's a job for you!$ Look sharper.I think it must be an ankle.$ Yeah.I think so somewhere.ted?$ Yes, dear?What have you done with me nail polish?$ I haven't seen it.$ Here.Hope this...$ It's Druce I'm after.$ Two seats...All right.$ How do you do, sir John?Won't you sit down?Thank you.$ You know, it seems to me, mr.$ Markham, that we as artists have a double function.$ We use life to create art and we use art to, how shall I put it... to criticize life.$ Oh, certain, mr.John.Uhh!$ Now, mr.$ Markham, between artists...Do we always fulfill our double function?$ Are we not so much occupied in using life to create art that we forget our other function?$ I foresee your objection.$ You're going to say, what opportunities does the round of daily life offer?$ If you ever saw a problem play I once did.$ Pistols for two.Oh, yes.$ When a high-brow shocker occurs in real life, does the public call in the actor?$ No.$ Uh... mr.Markham, I read your thoughts.$ You know, you're saying to yourself, this man is, um, talking to his hat.$ Oh, of course you are.Otherwise, you wouldn't be the practical manI take you for.$ You're also wondering to yourself, why on earth I've brought you here.Well...That brings me at last...$ To my object.$ Now...$ Yesterday and the day before,$ I was on the jury at the Baring trial.$ You impressed me both as an artist and as a man.$ By the way you gave your evidence.Now, I want from you, if I'm not being too indiscrete- - the inner history of that case.$ Oh, what is it that, uh...$ See, now, of course, um...$ Bennett talked over with you the question of that engagement?$ You see, we'd rather, uh...$ Rather hoped that you'd be free to take on the stage management when I send off this tour at christmas of The Green Eye.$ I also thought of working out some arrangement on a yearly bases but we could easily talk that over later$ Thank you very much indeed, sir John.$ I, uh...Well, I am free at the moment.$ And I've had a lot of experience that I'm sure will come in very handy.Then that's settled, huh?$ Uh, yes.What?What is it, mr.$ Markham?Well, it's my wife, sir John.$ You see, we've always been joint, as you may say and, uh...Well, would it be asking too much, sir John, if a part, I mean, any part that you- - ohh.I see.$ Acts, sir John?Heh.$ Well, uh...Perhaps it's not for me to say, but...$ Well, you may say I'm prejudiced, sir John, but I've been stage manager now for 10 years, and it is a fact that a wife, even a good one, is not always the right thing to have in a company,$ if you understand what I'm getting at,$ My Doucie, my wife--well, professionally, she's been my right hand.$ And there's no one she can't play 24 hours' notice.$ From a Gladys Cooper to a Molly Lloyd part.$ Has she ever- - she has her- -$ I was going to say she has her off days, of course.$ Well, who hasn't?Yes.I mean, only last summer$ I had to speak to her seriously about it.$ She had a quick change-over from a barmaid to a Salvation Army lass.$ And it told on her, there's no doubt about it, after about a week, I said to her straight out:$ " Now look here, my dear, this can't go on if you can't pull yourself together, we shall have to go into Shakespeare."$ Well, she didn't say much.Not one that was reasonable.$ I'll give you my word, sir John, she was tallulah.$ She's downstairs waiting in the- -$ Oh.One minute then.$ Let's send for her to come up.$ What, is that you, Bennett?$ I'm sorry.No.Wait.$ Hello, Bennett, mrs.Markham is somewhere downstairs.$ Would you have her sent up, please?Yes.$ Yes, of course.Up to my room.Now, mr.$ Markham...About this trial...$ I confess to feeling very uneasy about it.$ You see, I played a part in the thing, the part of a juryman.And it was not until the curtain was rung down on the death sentence, that I said to myself...$ This is not a play, this is life.$ Life can be less kind than your dramatists, mr.Markham.$ Life permits a beautiful and unfortunate girl to go to the gallows.$ Unless- - art for once can bring its technique to bear.$ Good lord, do you mean to say she is innocent, my dear Markham, yes.$ It was assumed she was guilty because she couldn't deny it.$ Yes, but I saw the- -$ Diana Baring sitting beside the dead body.She was dazed you say.$ What was the cause?Drink?She hardly ever touched anything.$ And who did?Think it over, mr.$ Markham.$ Was she examined by a doctor?$ Might he not have found traces of a blow if he'd examined her?But no, he didn't.$ He assumed like everyone else that she was guilty because she didn't deny it.$ And there was no private investigation, no inquiry, think it over, mr.$ I feel the most terrible responsibility.$ I was one of the 12 people who decided the fate of this poor girl.$ I found myself caught up with the machine that- - that makes these things...$ Oh, I was quite glad, glad as a breath of fresh air.What a charming place you have up here, sir John.Oh.$ And Piccadilly, with all the shops so near.$ You'll, um...$ You'll stay to lunch, of course.$ I find it difficult sometimes to wait to a reasonable hour for my luncheon.$ I feel the same way myself.$ That I can do without my little tidbits in the morning...$ Markham is free to join me.So...Please.$ Oh, thank you.$ Oh, one moment, please.$ In the meantime, success to our researches.$ Your husband and I have been discussing the Baring case.$ And get Diana off you mean?But she can't get away from that poker.$ If you don't share our convictions that miss Baring is not guilty- -$ well, I mean to say Diana Baring was such a nice girl.$ I never thought for one moment she could've done a thing like that.$ Didn't I always say, Ted, never could've thought it for one moment?$ Oh, sir John, have you found anything out?$ Are you going to take it up yourself?$ Oh, we would be so glad to help, wouldn't we, Ted?$ Shall we now?$ Well, yes, sir John.$ Oh, I see.Uh...$ Yes.I wish I knew where to begin.$ Here.$ Yes, can I help you there?$ Sir John didn't know where to begin, Ted.$ Markham.See, I'm completely in the dark.If your husband could show the way,$ I shall be more than grateful.$ Go on.What is it, Markham?$ Well, sir John...$ I should say the best place would be the back of the town where the murder was committed.$ Yes.$ Do you think you could spare me a day or two of your time?$ Why, yes, of course we could, sir.$ See, if I might suggest that we could go over the ground and you could show me one or two places connected with the murder.$ But, you mean, it might have been someone else altogether, who killed Edna Druce?$ It might've been somebody from outside.How do you make that out?Well, I don't know.$ And miss Diana didn't.So it must've been somebody from outside.If it was, they'd have to get in.$ And they'd have to get out again.$ Heh.That's clever.Well, all I can say is...$ The first thing we got to do is to find out who saw somebody, apart from Druce, anywhere near there at half-past one that morning.$ Well, Ted, for start, there's that chap we thought was the policeman coming around the corner.Oh, that was nothing.$ I shall like to hear something about this policeman.$ Well, you see, sir John, it was like this...Only after the murder, when the knocking woke us up,$ I was over by the window and I popped my head out of the window to see who it was making all that noise.$ And I saw the policeman coming around the corner.$ I said, hey, it's the police.$ And then I took my eyes off him to tell Ted here...$ And when I looked again, there was no one in sight.$ And then Ted said, yes, you're right.$ Here he comes.$ And when I looked again, it was a different policeman altogether.$ What had become of the first one?$ He must have turned the corner and come back.$ We only took our eyes off of him about 2 seconds.Uh...$ Is there anymore here do you think, sir?$ I shouldn't think so.$ My god, that's Druce.$ He must be crazy.$ Yeah, we better get down.$ You are not going in my house.$ Take him away, please.$ He's done this before.Please, promise to stop it.Yes, that's all right.$ Now come along, Druce.My wife's...$ But you're much better at home.$ Come on.Come on now.$ That is, if you don't mind.$ May I?Oh.Yes, sir.$ Of course.Yes.Certainly.$ Will you come in?$ Well, sir John, that's where they found the body.$ And, uh...Miss Baring was sitting just about there.$ Oh, by the way, did you ever get your poker back, miss- - oh, I can't bear to talk about it, especially with poor miss Baring being where she is.$ Why, you might as well convict Cleopatra.$ You think anybody could've got in from the back of the house?$ You see just beyond the backyard there's an alleyway, and just beyond there there's the theatre.$ And look, sir, the dressing rooms are at the back.Yes, it would take quite an athlete to get in that way.$ I don't see how anyone could get in here with this aspidistra filling up the window.$ Anyway, without upsetting it, and look at the size of it.$ But miss Baring did not have any visitors, only mrs.Markham every now and again, and mr.$ Fane and mr.$ Stewart to tea and mister- - what's his name- - the little man with the squeaky voice.$ Oh, Tom Druid.$ Yes.$ Yes, that's him.$ Squeaky voice, that reminds me.$ In your evidence, miss Mitcham, you said you had heard angry women's voices.$ Yes, sir, I did.$ Will you swear to that?$ Oh, yes, sir.$ You can't mistake a woman's voice.$ You know, I had known a contralto- - oh, yes, but this was high, quite high.$ Miss Mitcham.Miss Mitcham.$ Oh, my god, miss Mitcham.Where are you?$ The kitchen chimney's on fire, miss Mitcham!That's alice.One moment, miss Mitcham.$ I can't stop just now.That Alice of mine has set the kitchen chimney on fire.$ Didn't you hear her calling?No, no, no.That was me.$ Or did I...You know, Markham, I never know.$ I played a trick on you, miss Mitcham.$ Now, the high voice you heard that night may not have been a woman's.$ You've just admitted it.$ I have not admitted anything.And I don't hold to playing such tricks.$ And I'd like to ask you, sir, what you mean by it.And you, too, mr.Markham.$ Standing there, grinning.$ You realize that your evidence as it stands may hang miss Baring?$ Now, I'm not blaming you.$ Not blaming you, miss Mitcham.$ But you swore that you heard women's voices calling.$ And I have to prove to them that it might have been a man's voice, especially a high-pitched man's voice- - just like mr.$ Druid's.Ohh!$ I'd do anything for miss Baring.Oh, can't something be done now?$ Yes, yes.Now you're going to help us further.$ First of all, could you show us some more of the house?$ I don't think you'll find much in here, sir.$ Well, let me have them and I'll send them on.$ Uh...$ Lot more places to go to, sir John.$ Thank you.$ Thank you very much indeed.Thank you.Thank you very much.$ Lot more places, sir John.$ And then we'll go round to Stewart's lodgings and then we might go along to the police station, have a chat with the inspector.$ He knows me.And then, um...$ Well, then we can go across the Red Lion, have a sandwich while we're talking to Joe the proprietor.$ And then--ooh, and then there's Stevens, if the policeman's still on his beat.$ Yes, I think that's about all we can do.Oh, yes, we'll find out something if it takes us all night.$ Don't you worry about Doucie and me.We've had to go without before, didn't we, dear?$ Well, shall we begin, sir John?$ This way.$ I've come to see if any of my people left anything behind.$ No, nothing, except that there broken basin in number 4 dressing room.$ Of your chaps after they left.They never paid for it neither.$ Did he wear a policeman's uniform?$ If she still refuses to give the name...$ Perhaps the cigarette case will help her to remember.$ They were calling about on the night of the murder?$ Thank you.$ It's very good of you to have come.But I can't help saying...$ I'm extremely surprised.Well, you see, I...$ Don't let's talk about it.$ How's your play going?$ Pretty fair.$ Of course you know I was away from it some time because I was on the jury of your trial.$ I know.$ My countryhouse is in that district.$ As you know, I can't discuss with you what happened on the jury...$ Is Muriel Heatherly still playing the lead with you?I do think she's such a good actress.Don't you?$ Miss Baring...You remember our meeting?Oh, yes.$ You do remember.Of course.$ Very well.$ If I hadn't sent you away on tour to get experience...You wouldn't be in this position now.That's, in a way, why I feel...$ Sort of...$ That's why I've come.$ I knew that would happen.$ I knew someone would try and get me off and think they were doing me a kindness.$ Imprisonment for life.$ Why, a week of it's nearly driven me crazy.If they want to do the other thing...$ They can.$ It'll be no worse than the dentist.$ And if I have done this thing, as they say I have,$ As for the other thing, if you're a friend to me, you couldn't do it.$ Lock yourself up in your own room...For one day.$ Only for one day and see.$ Tell me what I want to know,$ I'll have you out of here altogether.$ What is that?$ I can tell you.Tell me the name of the man discussed by you and Edna Druce.$ I've said so many times before.$ He has no connection with the case.$ Besides,$ I didn't quarrel.$ Edna Druce tried to say poisonous things about him.$ And I just put my fingers in my ears and kept them there.$ So that you actually couldn't hear a sound.$ You couldn't have heard of any other person that had come into the room.No.$ I suppose I couldn't.$ Why wouldn't you listen to her?Because...$ I knew what Edna was trying to tell me.$ What was she trying to tell you?$ I can't answer that.$ Plenty of other people have been involved in this case.Markham, Stewart, Druce...Fane.$ Why shouldn't this one man's name be known?There was something...$ Something he daren't have known.$ But which you knew.$ Yes.What was it?$ You realize what you're admitting by your silence?$ Because you know you're in love with him.$ Oh, but that's impossible.$ Impossible?Why should it be impossible?$ I see no reason why it should be impossible.$ Why, the man's a half-caste.$ What's that?$ What did you say?$ A half-caste?$ Black blood!Why haven't you said so much?$ Tell me the rest.$ What was his name?$ I won't tell you that.$ Will this help you to remember the name of the man you were quarelling about?$ That's not one of Stewart's things.$ You mustn't give the prisoner anything here, sir.$ And the time for the interview has nearly ended, sir.$ Oh, sir John.$ For these last few moments, let's talk about something else.Yes.$ There was a photograph of me in your room.$ How did you know?I went there to make inquiries.$ How did you come to get it?$ I've always been keen on the stage ever since I was a little girl.$ One has one's heroes.$ That's why I came to you for a job.$ Oh, let's talk some more quickly.$ Diana, I...$ Your photograph with them.$ I've got it in my cell now.They let us keep some- - come.$ Time's up please.$ Good-bye.$ I'm going to find Fane.$ Handell Fane.$ Handell Fane.What's become of Handell Fane?$ Any news of Fane yet, Markham?$ Not yet, sir John.$ I'm trying some more of the agents though.$ Haven't you found Fane yet, Ted?$ I can't bear the suspense.$ We shall be up all night, you know.$ Oh, for god's sake.Hello?$ He's wanted for an important job, you know.$ Yes, at once.What's that?Gone back to his old job?$ What?Trapeeze artist?$ Where?$ No, can't stop now.$ Got him at last.$ Yes, that's him all right.$ Dressed up as a woman, eh?$ Always was good at that.$ An extremely clever way of hiding.$ Markham?Yes, sir?$ I've an idea.$ You know your Hamlet?Every line of it, sir.Then let me suggest for your consideration the series of events embodied in act 3, scene 2.$ That's the play scene, isn't it, sir?Yes.$ The play scene.Do you remember the title...The mousetrap?$ 2 cats to one mouse.Yes, but what about the cheese, sir?$ A villain's part in the blood and thunder in a play that I'm going to write especially for him.$ A play based on a recent well-known murder case.$ I imagine he will play his part, as I hope we shall convince him...$ Come in.$ Can you give me a minute?$ How do you do?Sit down.$ Here you are.$ Oh, thank you.$ Oh.$ Thank you.$ No, Bennett, don't go.$ I may need you.$ You see, I always conduct these interviews so badly,$ I'm just as likely as not to leave out the really important points.$ Bennett has told you the author of the play?No, sir John.$ I understand you wish that to be kept a secret for the time being.$ Well, I wrote the play.$ That was a simple matter, but it's proving astonishingly difficult to find the right person for one particular part.$ Might I ask you to stand up for one moment?$ Of course.$ You know, Bennett, he looks it.$ He looks it quite perfectly.Exactly what I've been thinking, sir John.$ Would you mind- - oh, sit down, do.Would you mind reading one or 2 lines?$ Tell--what's his name- - Baldwin to bring me a clean copy of act 3.Thank you.Sir John?$ What kind of play is this exactly?$ Well, you may question my taste, but as an artist, you'll understand my temptation.$ My subject, mr.$ Fane, is the inner history of the Baring case.$ Your indifference astonishes me.$ Aren't I right in thinking that you were a member of the Druce company at the time?$ Then you knew both women concerned.$ Yes, I knew them both quite well.$ Now, let's begin.Oh, by the way, mr.Fane,$ Would that interfere?$ No, it was my old job, and I've gone back to it because times have been a little difficult and- - however, I understand you wouldn't be starting for 2 or 3 weeks.$ Let me give you...$ Some idea of the scene.$ Here is a table in front of a fireplace, more or less a....On the table there's the remains of a meal.$ And, of course, the brandy flask.$ Fane, of course, you know all the details of the case.$ I can't help wondering, why nothing spectacular developed in connection with the brandy.$ I can't help feeling that the brandy was not exploited with sufficient imagination.Then, of course, the law has no sense of drama, has it?$ No.No.$ Then again, let me see.$ I thought it best to begin from a point just before the actual murder.$ In the middle of it, you make your entrance, on the words--I got this from the evidence- -$ I can tell you things about your friends that you don't know."$ Now, how on earth did you know the entrance was from the window?$ That's highly clever.$ And look, mr.Fane, you've forgotten your script.$ The script.$ I can tell you things..."$ Wouldn't it be better if I were to pick up the poker before I made the entrance to the room?$ Excellent idea.$ May I have the poker?$ No, I'm terribly sorry.$ We only have electric fires here.$ Would this pencil do?$ Very well.$ We must get on without the poker.You can use your imagination, eh?Now then...$ Through the window, into the room.$ Don't you know that he's a half- -"$ I thought perhaps...$ You might be able to collaborate with us.$ You'll allow me to give you another reading.$ I shan't be...$ How do you do, sir John?$ Who'd have thought of seeing you here?$ Well, you see, I'm, uh...I'm working for sir John now.$ Markham is helping me with my new play.$ I suppose you find brandy steadying for the nerves?$ Mine's very nerving work, you see, sir John?$ You never know what may happen.$ You're next.I presume you've come to talk to me about...That part again, sir John.$ Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all.$ " facing each other in dead silence.$ " They are so lost in the tension of the moment$ " He hurls the first woman aside." She is stunned by the fall,$ " but he doesn't notice it.$ " Infuriated,$ " he strikes out at the other woman$ " with the poker.$ " She falls by the fireplace,$ " then he sees the other woman beginning to stir.$ A leap or two.$ Finally, a climb into the theatre dressing room."$ That accounts for the broken basin." But how to get home undetected from the theatre.An idea.$ The policeman's uniform he wore on the stage."There's your policeman, Markham.$ " He walks home a murderer.$ " A murderer on an impulse." The silence of the mouth of a woman$ " who knew his secret and was going to reveal it" to the woman he dared to love.$ There's a melodrama for you, sir John."$ Well, Markham...$ You have it all.$ Poor devil.$ And Diana Baring...$ She knew all the time...$ He was a half-caste.$

Wolf -$ In this one-sided battle, the poor wolf lost his tail.$ Coming back home after this memorable hiding, he still found that the fox had other surprises for him.$ To this great fortress... came all the fox's victims to lodge their complaints.$ I'm here to reclaim my cheese, with accrued interest.$ And you?$ So am I, but don't tell it.$ All were here to seek justice from the king of the beasts...$ His Majesty the Lion.$ The queen, charming, coquettish and greedy was only interested in the Ortolan brochettes.$ Speak fearlessly, Sir Wolf.$ Here is my complaint, Sire.$ The fox again?$ Read it clerk.$ Read it.$ " Sire, I demand compensation$ " for a cold,$ " nervous breakdown and stolen hams."$ The fox is up to his tricks again.$ Silence in court -

depends.$ I want to see your cousin Reynard here at court, where signal punishment awaits him.$ You alone seem cunning enough to persuade him to come.$ If by tomorrow you have not succeeded, you will be punished in his stead.$ I shall try, Sire.$ The lion is in great good mood, I assure you, you have nothing to fear.$ I'm not all sure of the king's good intentions towards me.$ I will answer for him with my life, believe me.$ You sure cannot imagine the reception that awaits you.$ I'll sleep on it and I'll think about it.$ That night, the fox had a remarkable nightmare.$ So, male and female, the great day has now dawned$ To settle these disruptive disputes, the king has decided on single combat between Sire Reynard, squire of Malpertuis and his enemy the wolf.$ Captain Bear, that noted master of single combat, will see fair play.$ The wolf has entered the list$ A stir of excitement announces the fox's arrival.$ Doffing his cape,$ Reynard reveals a dazzling suit of armour.$ He bows.$ What an eye-catching figure.$ Fierce and alert, the wolf looks at him askance.$ The king wears the modest uniform of a Corporal of the guard.$ The queen looks charming in brocaded satin, delightfully trimmed with fresh ermine.$ The fox has dealt the first telling blow, but his adversary regains his feet.$ The battle, listeners, is now waxing fast and furious.$ Excuse me, but I can't really see.$ The wolf has grabbed the fox tail, he's raining axe blows on him.$ Captain Bear is firmly in control.$ Another right from the wolf.$ But his axe has broken and hit Captain Bear in the belly.$ The battle, nevertheless, goes on, with the wolf belabouring the fox.$ The fox has his second wind.$ And the wolf is down.$ The fox hammers the wolf.$ The wolf grabs and throws the fox, the fox is finished.$ Now Reynard, you are mine.$ It's all over, I'm going to die in your arms.$ So, as one might have predicted, the result is a victory for...$ In a very good mood, Reynard decided to go see

the cat's guilty, though he's in love with the queen?$ Speak without fear.$ You and I, Sire, are victims of a conspiracy.$ I hardly dare reveal the danger that threatens us.$ The bear, your Captain of the guard, has a burning desire to rule in your place.$ His dream is to kill you and your lovely queen.$ And then to settle on your throne.$ Being too cowardly to act himself, he enlisted the cat, who

way.$ This is not the first time, Reginald.$ Excuse me a moment, change of clothes.$ - What have they done with her?$ - With Mary?$ Still at the station, I think.$ Has she said anything?$ Can I help?$ My God, you don't think she really has done it?$ It's terrible!$ Why did they arrested her?$ It was to be expected.$ I saw it with my own eyes.$ The blood covered fire poker in her hand, or at least near her.$ Stop it!$ What's with you, my boy?$ The mere mention of blood makes me shudder.$ No, no, wait!$ There is still time.$ Be calm, my friend.$ Attention!$ Go!$ Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.$ Mary Baring stands accused for the murder of Ellen Moore.$ She has pleaded not guilty.$ Your task, ladies and gentlemen, will be to determine whether she is guilty or not.$ Needless to say, in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.$ Even a murder committed by a woman must be judged dispassionately by you.$ Neither youth nor beauty...$ I could certainly not let my self tolerate her demeanour.$ And suddenly she gave me such a strange look.$ And then... then I can't remember anything else.$ - Did you speak about any particular person?$ I will not answer that question.$ It has nothing to do with this.$ Whatever I have done, must have happened when I was not conscious of myself.$ I... know nothing more.$ The defense stresses that guilt has not been proven and repudiates all charges.$ You, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have been able to observe the behaviour of the accused.$ The prosecutor has called this behaviour stubborn and indifferent.$ But, ladies and gentlemen, only a truly innocent person can be indifferent towards such an accusation.$ If you are convinced that the defence represents the facts, it is your duty to release the accused.$ However, I must point out that the accused is a talented actress.$ Though if you are convinced that she has committed the deed in full consciousness, then I can only remind you of the words of the prosecutor:$ that neither beauty nor youth are extenuating circumstances.$ Go and consider the facts for yourselves.$ It seems unnecessary to examine all the evidence in detail.$ With your permission,I'd like to summarise the facts of the case.$ It has been established that the defendant and the victim were at odds.$ The defendant invited the victim to supper.She wanted reconciliation.$ They both drink some and they start discussing a man.$ Proof for this is that the landlady heard loud voices.$ The defendant admits this, but refuses to reveal the man's name.$ That's understandable.$ But that's not all.$ The defendant lost her temper, she grabbed the fire poker and that's how Ellen Moore was murdered.$ The prosecutor believes that the facts are beyond doubt.$ She was caught in flagranti.$ The fire poker by her side, clothes covered with blood.The empty bottle of brandy and she herself in a half-unconscious state.$ What's more, no one else came into the house.$ The defence argues that there is a possibility that she could have acted under a fit or something like that.$ Surely it is clear that in the evidence for the defence the medical expert put forward the following theory:$ We know that under the influence of a very strong emotion, an individual can act without being aware of their actions.$ Actions the individual do not remember at all when she regains her normal mental state.$ And for which one therefore can not be held accountable...$ Yeah, well...$ It's probably best if we all write down our verdicts.$ Then we can see how we stand.$ Those in the minority can then explain their individual reasons.$ And we'll work it out...$ Oh...NOT GUILTY.$ And we'll work it out that way.$ GUILTY.$ So, here are... seven guilty and three not guilty altogether.$ I take it you haven't come to a decision?$ This whole case is terrible.$ There's too much responsibility put on our shoulders.$ Either we can let her go free, but if she's a murderer, that's wrong to society.$ Or else we get her hung, and that I find barbaric.$ What if we appeal for mercy?$ Do you call that mercy?$ 20 years in prison?$ To spend the best years in hell?$ Do you even know what jail means?$ It takes a civilised society to invent a punishment like that.$ I think you exaggerate a bit.$ It's no use confusing the issue.$ People who commit a crime has got to be punished.$ You can't run the world on sentiment.$ You're right, but at least you've got to try.$ You have to help the guilty, instead of having children and then start wars to get rid of them again.$ The world is a reeking pit of sentiment!$ Your verdict, Mr. Shackleton.$ Guilty.$ So now remaining is only the three who voted not guilty.$ I'll explain my reasons for the verdict.$ The advice of the medical expert is beyond dispute.$ As anyone who has studied modern psychology knows, a person with a high sensitivity can under strong stress, here explainable considering that the prisoner is an actor, end up in situations in which they are no longer conscious of their actions.$ Perhaps she is right.$ But maybe this condition then will repeat itself, and possibly with the same results.$ Yes, that's a point I have not considered.$ If she's found innocent and something would happen...Then we will have blood on our hands!$ Do you wish to change your verdict, Mrs. Ward?$ And you, dear Mr. Daniels, does your opinion remain the same?$ Well, I've got to say I find the whole thing incredible...$ I mean...$ Everyone would like to have a girl like her for a daughter.$ Do not let your verdict be influenced by this young lady's qualities and their appeal to you.$ Yeah, I can understand that, but I mean, I...$ This whole story is so terrible!$ Leaving your thoughts aside, what is your verdict?$ Well...OK...$ Guilty.$ Then we all agree,With the exception of Sir John.$ But you won't influence me as easily as the others, Mr. chairman.$ Let's not be too long.Time is money, you know.$ Time is money.In this case even more than that.$ A life is at stake.$ I'm an actor, not a businessman.$ If I take my time, I apologize.$ So speak then, Sir John.$ I am convinced that Mary Baring tells the truth when he says that she does not remember anything.$ Her behaviour during the trial made a deep impression on me.$ But don't think that I'm taking the same line as Mr. Daniels here.$ He wanted to be gallant.$ For my part, I will go further.$ To me it's obvious that she did not drink the brandy.$ You've forgotten that the doctor said she smelled of alcohol!$ But maybe that was from the wine they had for dinner?$ It confirms that the two women had been enemies for some time.$ He said the accused wanted to attack Mrs. Moore on stage.$ It's all proof that she is a violent nature.$ But Mr. Fane said the opposite!$ Unfortunately his testimony has no value.$ He seems in love with the accused.$ Everything was clear when they found the body,$ The fire poker by her side.$ And they quarrelled over a man.$ What say you, Sir John?$ You'll have to keep her personality in mind.$ Is she the kind of woman to get drunk?$ But there was a bottle of cognac there!$ She's not denying that.$ Answers, Sir John?$ The question is, was someone else in the house that night?$ The landlady said no.$ The accused says they were alone.$ And said that they fought.$ It's clear then.$ That is not the response of a guilty!$ - Caught red-handed!$ - Clothes covered in blood!$ - You refuse to acknowledge it?$ - Waste of time, waste of money.$ - Cognac...$ - Blood on her hands...$ How do you respond to that, Sir John?$ Now that the verdict is unanimous, I'll notify the judge.$ Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?$ Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?$ Guilty.$ Mary Baring, do you have anything to add to avoid the death penalty?$ But...$ It's absurd.$ It can't be true.$ Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!$ Silence while the death sentence is passed upon the prisoner.$ In her trial at the criminal court today, an unanimous jury found the actress Mary Baring guilty of the murder of Ellen Moore, wife of theatre director Moore, and sentenced her to the death penalty.$ This station has received a S.O.S.$ We therefore interrupt our program for five minutes.$ After the break a concert will...$ - Mr. Bennett is here.$ - I'm coming.$ I'm glad you're back, sir John.$ The audience demands you.$ And this process has been excellent publicity.$ Sure, seeing Ms. Baring again was not all pleasant for you.$ She wanted to be our star.$ When was that?$ Hardly a year ago.$ In a way she's finally achieved it, but in a very dramatic way.$ But Bennett!$ - Could you bring me my mail?$ - Sure.$ We continue our program.$ The Radio symphony orchestra brings you the overture from Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and$ Strange this S.O.S. earlier.$ Save our souls.$ Save her soul.$ Save her.$ Had I been stronger, then I would have convinced everyone.$ Why did these fools not see the poor girl like I did?$ In court, everyone look different from how they usually look.$ Strange.$ What are you thinking?$ Who drank the brandy?$ Why didn't I put more emphasis on that point?$ Easy to say afterwards...$ She said she didn't drink the brandy.$ Yet she admits she might have committed the murder.$ Denying such a detail and letting herself be convicted of murder without protesting.$ I was right.$ How do we know that someone else didn't drink the brandy?$ Could be!$ That is the crucial point!$ Who drank the brandy?$ Have I done the right thing?$ No.$ - No what?$ - No mail.$ Make sure you get hold of my understudy.I won't play.$ And call my lawyer.$ No wait, I know the number by heart.$ Museum 1223.$ It's an inquiry into the current whereabouts of the troupe with which Miss Baring was at work.$ And locate that small man stage manager, or theatre director or what he was.$ I'll see him in my office in the morning.$ I thought the trial was over.$ It is far from over!$ - Oh, it's for the publicity!$ - Come on, Bennett.Publicity?$ The line is busy$ - Publicity?$ - Well, why not?$ Yes Mr. Brown lives here$ Yes, but he is not at home.$ He is ill and is in the hospital.$ What?$ Dr. Meyer?$ If I can transmit a message?$ But I haven't got a transmitter...$ Pardon?$ Sir John?$ Oh, eh...$ Wait a second, hold on!$ I think Mr. Brown came home just now...$ Hey, they're calling on behalf of Sir John!$ Yes I'm Mr. Brown.$ Good morning, Doctor.$ Oh, thank you.$ No, no, nothing serious, just a small scratch.$ Yes, from the briefcase...$ Of course, with pleasure!I'll come at once.$ I was about to go to the bank, but never mind.$ Yes, at once.Thank you.$ Hey, that was about a job.$ Oh Bobby, in that case we won't have to pack!$ Don't talk about packing.$ I have to get dressed!$ Bring me my white gloves!$ If this works out, then I'll...$ - Then!$ Ah, Mr. Brown!$ How are you?$ Quite good, thank you.$ - Have a seat.$ - Thanks.$ At the Baring trial these last few days, you made a strong impression as a man and as an artist.$ That's why I would like to review some details with you.$ Has Bennett already told you about your employment?$ Yes, I wanted you to work with us as stage manager.$ A year's employment.$ But we'll talk to Bennett about that.$ Thank you very much, I'm lucky...$ I mean, how fortunate that I'm free at the moment.$ I will do everything I can.$ You can be sure that everything will be swell.$ So, it's settled then?$ Any problems, Mr. Brown?$ My wife...$ My wife and I have always worked together... and I thought, if it's not asking too much...$ Maybe a small role?$ - Where is your wife?$ - Waiting downstairs.$ Why didn't you say so?$ Let's have her come up.$ - Should I?I can...$ - Never mind, I'll call.$ Hello?Oh, excuse me, it's a mistake.$ Bennett?$ Could you send up Mrs. Brown?$ Returning to the trial...$ I have taken this matter very seriously.$ I played a difficult role.$ The role of a juryman.$ And when the curtain fell on the death penalty$ fear gripped me.$ This was not theatre, it was life!$ And life is not as kind as the theatre$ It permits a poor innocent girl to be condemned to death.$ Unless art comes to correct life at the last minute.$ My God!$ Do you mean...That Mary Baring is innocent?$ That's right.$ That's what I mean.$ She was convicted only because she did not deny it.$ - But I saw...$ - What did you see, Mr. Brown?$ Mary Baring next to the dead body, confused.$ Why?$ Drunk?$ She never drinks.$ So someone else must have done the drinking, Mr. Brown.$ Why did she go into the other room for the fire poker?$ Accused of murdering Mrs. Moore because she didn't deny it.$ And everyone is happy.$ Without any questions!$ Without any responsibility!$ I'm delighted, Ms. Brown!$ It is a pleasure to be here.$ Getting some fresh air, seeing some people...$ What a wonderful apartment!$ And this neighbourhood with all its stores!$ You'll have lunch with us?$ God, I'm starving!$ Thank you.$ Harvey, bring us a cocktail.$ And then have the lunch served.$ Hey, he's hired us, the both of us!$ - Really?$ - Yes!$ But please, sit down.$ I happened to notice that you are unemployed, and...$ A toast to our research!$ Yes, your husband and I seem to agree that the Baring trial must be approached from a completely different angle.$ Really?$ Ah, to free Mary Baring!$ But that's futile, unfortunately.$ So you do not share our opinion?That Ms. Baring is innocent?$ No, I mean, yes...$ Mary Baring was an adorable colleague and I personally never thought her capable of such a thing.$ Isn't that true, Bobby?I've always said that no one who knows her could have thought it.$ Do you want to take the matter in your own hands, Sir John?$ Have you found anything out?$ Oh, we would be so delighted if we could be of any help.Isn't that so, Bobby?$ I really don't know where to start.$ Do you have any ideas, Brown?$ Well, I've played in many crime plays, and there the first thing is to lay out a real plan.$ But Bobby, why would you have a plan if Sir.$ No, no, Ms. Brown, please let him.$ I'm really in the dark here.$ I would very much like your husband to help me.$ To begin with, we must return to the scene of the crime.$ Do you think you can spare me a few days of your time?$ But of course!$ Then you could show me where the murder took place.$ Do you really think someone else did it?$ After all, it's even possible it was a complete stranger.$ How so?$ If it was not Ms. Miller and not Mary Baring, then there must have been a third person.$ This person would have to get in and get out somehow.$ Good reasoning!$ Most important is to find out if there was someone else at the scene at 1.30 AM, apart from Moore of course.$ Bobby, there was a policeman on the corner.$ - That doesn't matter, honey...$ - Wait a second!$ What policeman?$ In the middle of night, we awoke by a terrible banging on the door.$ We went to the window to see who made the fuss.$ I saw a man on the corner that looked like a policeman.$ So I said:$ A policeman is coming.$ And then Bobby looked outside and saw one too, but that one came from the other side.$ - And where did the first one go?$ - I have no idea.$ He must have turned the corner and gone back.$ - That corner?$ - Right.$ You're sure it wasn't the same policeman?$ It's impossible.$ We lost sight of him for just a short while.$ God, it's Moore!$ He's gone crazy!$ We better get down.$ Moore, be reasonable now.$ My wife...$ Let's go home now.$ Excuse me, this gentleman would like to take a look inside your house.$ That is, if you don't mind?$ - May I?$ Here are a few of her things.$ I can't send it to her.$ Give them to me, I'll bring them to her.$ But that's your photo!$ Eh, we're not finished yet.$ Is it possible to come in from the back of the house?$ See for yourself!$ The garden begins there.$ Over there's the theatre$ To me it's seems impossible.$ - Yeah, right.$ It would have to be an athlete.$ And it would have destroyed the plants.$ Did Ms. Baring have many visits?$ No, not many.$ Ms. Brown now and then, and Mr. Stewart and Mr. Fane.$ And that funny little man what's his name?$ - Tom Brent.$ Good afternoon, what's new?$ Anything for us?$ No nothing special, a broken wash basin in the number 4.$ It was certainly one of you.$ Who was in that room?$ Stewart and Fane, I think.$ No, none of us broke that.$ There is another thing.$ This cigarette box was found?You know who it belongs to?$ I'll find out who it is.$ Can we see that dressing room?$ I'd like to see that broken basin.$ Ok, come with me.$ - What do you see from the window?$ - The house on the corner.$ I sure would like to know who broke that basin.$ Finally we're here.$ We wish you a good night's sleep.$ I'll come by early in the morning.$ It's time to get to bed.Good night.$ Oh, be quiet now!$ Take it before it spills.$ Do you want the plate in bed or on a chair?$ What are you doing?$ Stop it, leave it be!$ Get off of there and leave that bag alone!$ Just wait until your father comes home, then you'll see!$ That child is too curious.It earned him a real beating once.$ But he hadn't done anything serious.$ I wanted Mr. Stewart to describe what happened, but it was during the Baring trial.$ My husband found the body, you know.$ And he enjoyed the trial.$ Ha-ha, Edith is usually not this merry, but she's seems fond of you!$ Do you have kids too?$ Tell me, why did Mr. Stewart give the child a beating?$ Well, I'll tell you.$ Little Arthur was playing with the suitcase, and he took out a police uniform.$ He thought it belonged to his father.$ And then I heard a terrible scream.$ Is that a reason to hit a child?$ The next day I told Mr. Fane.$ I wanted advice, because I was a bit worried.$ But he just turned around and said he knew nothing about it.$ I said:$ If it isn't yours, it must be your colleague Stewart's.$ Come in, my dear Brown.$ Can we talk a minute?$ I'll bring some hot water.$ Come on down!$ Come on, boys, get out!$ Go and play in the street!$ Charming house!$ - I have something to inform you.- Please.$ My wife and I have found something out.$ Do you remember the cigarette case the doorman gave us?$ Someone had forgotten it.- Yes, yes.$ I had put it in my pocket and this morning in bed$ I wanted to smoke, so I said to my wife: hand me my cigarettes.$ I asked her: do you know who this belongs to?$ She looked at it and said:$ My God, that's Stewart's case.$ Then she saw it had a beer stain$ So I said: then I should clean it before returning it.$ My wife started rubbing and suddenly said:$ That isn't beer, what could it be?$ You know what it was?Blood!$ See for yourself.$ Indeed.$ I think you're right.$ Stewart...$ Who wears a police uniform in your play?$ Fane and Stewart.$ Stewart played a policeman.$ And in the third act he changed clothes with Fane.$ In fact, we had an extra uniform for Fane.$ That allowed it to go faster.$ So we actually had two police uniforms.$ You've become an important factor in this case, Brown.$ A very important factor.$ I have an alibi!$ The most important factor is the policeman you did not see.$ At the night of the murder, your wife saw a policeman on the corner.$ When you arrived, it was gone.$ And then he reappeared.$ It was not the same person!$ You can be sure that the first one was not a real policeman.$ You mean that someone used one of our theatre uniforms to disguise as a policeman?$ We must find out the name of the man Mary is protecting.$ Was he a member of the company or someone else?$ Anyway, the cigarette case will make her talk.$ It is very kind of you to come and see me.$ But...$ I'm very surprised.$ I've taken a great interest in your case, and...$ Please, do not talk about it.$ How's your new play going?$ Well, thank you.$ Even though I was away for a while.$ You know, as a juror at your trial?$ I know.$ Could you answer a question regarding the case?$ I'm convinced that there are grounds for an appeal.$ You want to help me with that?$ Do you know the consequences?$ Appeal...$ Lifelong imprisonment.$ A single week has driven me half crazy!$ If you...$ If you want to appeal against the judgment, you should do it.$ I've accepted all of this.$ But at night...$ It can't be much worse than going to the dentist.$ And if I really did it in a moment of sickness, then it's better if I go away.$ But prison...$ If you are my friend, do not attempt anything!$ Lock yourself up in your room just for one single day, then you'll understand me.$ Tell me, tell me frankly.$ You wanted to work with me, to become a famous actress.$ This can be achieved if you help me a little.$ You can't imagine how I suffer for having contributed to your misery.$ And if you want to, Mary, you'll become a great actress.$ I'm convinced!$ What do you want me to say?$ The name of the man who was the subject of the discussion.$ He had nothing to do with it and we weren't arguing about him.$ I will explain to you.$ Ellen wanted to say bad things about him.$ And I covered my ears.$ So you could not hear if anyone came into the room?$ No, I don't think so.$ And why did you cover your ears?$ - I knew what she would say.$ - What was that?$ I can not tell you that.$ It would hurt someone terribly.$ Who has not suffered in this case?$ Moore, Fane, Stewart, you and me too!$ Why protect that person?$ Could you reveal the past of another person without it being a benefit to anyone?$ But perhaps that is the way of salvation!$ I believe in your innocence!$ I beg you, speak.$ Do you know what your silence means?$ You are in love with this man.$ That's not true!$ And the one you are protecting is Stewart.$ - This is Fane's case.$ You're not allowed to give the prisoner anything.$ The visit is over.$ Courage, Mary!$ I'll say!$ It's him, disguised as a woman.$ He's always been good at that.$ That's a good disguise.$ I have an idea, Brown.$ I'll ask Mr. Fane to come to me.$ And I'll offer him an important role.$ Hey, we've found Fane.$ He'll surely fall in our trap!$ Sure, sure...$ Sherlock Holmes is no one compared to you.$ Don't be silly, the plan is not mine.$ Sir John had an ingenious idea.$ He wrote a play for it.$ That's the bait.And he'll offer Fane the lead in it.$ Any actor would bite the bait.$ If he is right and Fane is dangerous, then why are you mixed up in this?$ I'm just the prompter!$ - Do you have a moment?$ - Of course!$ Who is it?$ This is Mr. Handel Fane.$ Ah, this is the gentleman you suggested for the role?$ - Please, have a seat.$ Do stay Bennett, I might need you.$ I'm not good at negotiating.$ I always forget the most important details.$ Has Bennett told you who is the author of this work?$ No, not yet.$ - I am the writer.- Is that so?$ Oh, it was very easy.$ The only difficulty was to find the lead actor.$ Could you stand up, please?$ Excellent!$ Just as I've visualised him!That's how he has to look.$ I thought so too.$ Would you like to read me a few lines from the text?$ Just to give me some idea?$ This is illegible.$ Tell Waldron to bring me another.$ May I ask what is the theme of the play?$ My taste may surprise you.But as an artist, you'll understand what tempted me.$ It's about what preceded the Baring trial.$ You were a member of Moore's company at that time?$ Then you know the two women concerned?$ Quite well.$ Maybe we could start?$ At present you're engaged with the Circus Olympia.$ Is that an interference?$ No, that's my old job.$ I'm doing it again only because the times are tough.$ Besides, you'll hardly start for another 2 or 3 weeks?$ Bennett, if you may?$ To give you an idea of the scene...$ The table is standing in front of the fireplace, more or less like this is.$ On the table, remains of a meal.$ Below, a bottle of cognac...$ - You know, Mr. Fane...$ I'm surprised that this bottle of brandy... has played such an insignificant role in the trial.$ As a writer, I'd have given it much more importance.$ But of course, the court lacks imagination, right?$ I think...$ I think we'll go to the scene of the murder.$ It is preceded by a short dialogue between two women.$ While they quarrel, you make your entrance.$ The moment one of them says...$ And here we quote the statement of a witness:$ " I'll tell you things about your protégé, things you do not suspect."$ That's when you enter.$ Let's start, please.$ Bravo!$ You enter through the window.$ He understands the role, even without looking at the script.$ Yes, the script...$ Where were we?$ Ah, yes!$ " I'll tell you things about your protégé, things you do not suspect."$ I think it would be better if I have the fire poker with me before entering the room.$ Don't you think?$ Excellent idea!$ Please, continue.$ Could you give me the fire poker?$ Sorry, we only have electric heating here.$ Maybe my pen will do?$ Yes, this will work.$ Enters through the window...$ You sneak by the doors...$ You slowly approaches...$ The two women are facing each other.$ You are approaching slowly.Very slowly.$ So not to be seen or heard.$ The two women are facing each other.$ You come from behind!$ One of them yells:$ " I'll tell you..."$ What?$ The script is not finished.$ I was getting myself quite worked up.$ - I was hoping you'd help me!$ - No.$ I know nothing about writing.$ I'm not one of those actors who contribute to the work of eminent authors.$ Complete the scene yourself.$ I'll play the end.$ I'm sorry.$ I can not be of any help.$ Please see what time he performs at the circus tonight.$ I'm curious how good a trapeze artist is at playing comedy.$ Don't get upset, Bennett.$ He'll play his role until the end.$ One moment, Sir John.$ I'll be with you in a moment.$ - Please.$ - Good evening.$ - Good evening.$ I did not expect to see you again here, Brown.$ - Yes, Sir John hired me...$ - He helps me with my new work.$ It calms the nerves.$ Yes, I have a very demanding role.$ You never know what will happen.$ It's your turn.$ I assume you came here to talk about your play.$ That's right.$ Hurry, Fane!$ Oh, Sir John, it's an honour!$ Will you attend the show?$ No, thank you.$ I came to talk to Mr. Fane.$ Would you be so kind and wait for me?$ I think I can give you a good idea for the end of your play.$ Good.$ What's going on?$ This is for you.$ Perhaps this letter has something to do with what happened.$ It all fits together.$ Listen to this, Mr. Brown, here is the end of my play:$ By these words, he jumps in with the fire poker in his hand, pushes Mary, whose head hit the table, and collapses, unconscious.$ Then he strikes Ellen Moore$ And when he sees the bloody corpse, he nearly faints.$ He picks up the bottle of cognac and empties it, then returns to the theatre through the window.$ In his dressing room, he washes his hands.$ And breaks the sink in the process.$ To his horror, he sees the crowded street.That's when he gets the idea:$ To get home unnoticed disguised with the police uniform from the theatre.$ You see, Brown, there's your policeman.$ The rest we know, except for the motive.$ The threat of the murdered woman who wanted to reveal his past to the woman he loved.$ Poor devil!$ Mary Baring had known his secret for a long time.$ What was the secret?$ He had escaped from prison.And he lived in constant fear of being captured again.$ Please, don't cry.$

Do you really think so?$ - Oh, sure.All men are alike.$ They puff themselves up.$ You'd think they'd done something.- Oh, I hope he'll really be like that.$ - He will be.$ I don't know though.$ He's always yelling about living in a tenement... and what a sin it is to have children if you can't afford to give' em everything.$ I don't think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House.$ He was awful poor.$ That's why he thinks like that about it.$ Here he is.$ Don't say anything.$ - You still here?$ Dld you get your paper, Eddle?$ I got down there, and I didn't have any change.$ You can get one next week.They'll have a dozen new murders for you by then.$ Here, let me fix that tie.$ -

Oh, it'd be all right.$ - Not with me, it wouldn't.$ My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her... and sees that she don't want for nothin'.$ If I can't do that, I won't be a husband.$ Me take your money - you work all day - or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin' for.$ Listen.They got a name for guys like that.$ Oh, Eddie, I didn't mean to make you sore.$ I ain't sore.$ But I ain't as happy as I was.You can lay that on a line.$ It was our 10 weeks anniversary.$ And I had the store all picked out and everything.$ And, say, when I come in here tonight, I was walkin' on air.$ This kinda crumbs it all up.$ Gee, I didn't know you wasn't satisfied.$ Oh, Eddie, I am satisfied.$ It's all right.$ Let's not talk about it.$ -

I don't know.$ - You didn't think it up.That's why.$ Hey, wait a minute.$ Don't put that great big chair over there by the divan.$ - That's where the chair belongs.- No, it isn't.$ It belongs over on this side.$ Haven't you got any sense of balance?$ -

Would you like to live here, kid?$ - Oh, gee, would I?$ - Of course, we couldn't afford -$ - Why not?Well, we couldn't afford the money now.$ Well, why now?$ - Well, you wanna get your store first.$ - Yeah.$ Oh, yeah.$ That's right.$ Say, wait till you get a load of the bedroom.$ Come on!$ Say, if Eddie can get Dot a home like this, why can't you get me one?$ I thought that'd crop up.$ - Look at this.$ - Oh, this is swell.$ Listen, kid.$ There's a bed.$ You can't buy a better bed than that - 65 bucks.$ - But how did you -$ - Oh, Pat told me.$ Come on.$ Feel it.$ Just feel it.Ain't this a bed?$ Not like that old egg crate we sleep in.$ I've never seen you so enthusiastic.$ The house has sure made a hit with you.$ Come on.$ Now I'm gonna show you somethin'.$ Just grand.$ There's the bridges over there.And there's all New York to pick from.$ Ain't the lights great?$ And the East River.$ And stars.$ Aren't they beautiful?$ Not phony ones either.$ Gee, a roof like this would be a swell place for... kids to play.$ Wouldn't it, Eddie?$ You know, they could get plenty of fresh air... and their mothers wouldn't have to worry about streetcars... and taxis and trucks and things.$ You know, rich kids couldn't have a better place than this.$ You like it, don't you, kid?$ Oh, I think it's just grand.$ I'm awful glad for Pat and Sue.$ Okay.$ We better get back to the bunch now.$ You said it.Sue, it's the grandest flat I ever saw.$ -
